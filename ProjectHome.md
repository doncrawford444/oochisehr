Oochis EHR is an Electronic Health Record (EHR) solution-application. Oochis stands for Object-Oriented Community Health Information System. Features include creating, importing, managing, and exporting health record data. Intended use is in the professional management of digital health records. Oochis EHR is designed to be as intuitive as paper-based recording with the added values of modern decision support tools, reduced errors that come with automation, and portability of medical information between clinics using standardized messaging formats. Vitality manages information overload by reducing the computerized medical work flow paradigm to exactly five main windows: System Management; Charting; Decision Support; Messaging; and Practice Management. Written entirely in Java, Oochis EHR runs on most personal computers. Oochis EHR is also expected to be ported to Android and JavaScript devices?
