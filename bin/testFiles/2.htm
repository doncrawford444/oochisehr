TI  - Quantitative assessments of burn degree by high-frequency ultrasonic
      backscattering and statistical model.
PG  - 757-73
AB  - An accurate and quantitative modality to assess the burn degree is crucial
      for determining further treatments to be properly applied to burn injury
      patients. Ultrasounds with frequencies higher than 20 MHz have been
      applied to dermatological diagnosis due to its high resolution and
      noninvasive capability. Yet, it is still lacking a substantial means to
      sensitively correlate the burn degree and ultrasonic measurements
      quantitatively. Thus, a 50 MHz ultrasound system was developed and
      implemented to measure ultrasonic signals backscattered from the burned
      skin tissues. Various burn degrees were achieved by placing a 100  degrees
      C brass plate onto the dorsal skins of anesthetized rats for various
      durations ranged from 5 to 20 s. The burn degrees were correlated with
      ultrasonic parameters, including integrated backscatter (IB) and Nakagami
      parameter (m) calculated from ultrasonic signals acquired from the burned
      tissues of a 5 x 1.4 mm (width x depth) area. Results demonstrated that
      both IB and m decreased exponentially with the increase of burn degree.
      Specifically, an IB of -79.0 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- standard deviation) dB for
      normal skin tissues tended to decrease to -94.0 +/- 1.3 dB for those
      burned for 20 s, while the corresponding Nakagami parameters tended to
      decrease from 0.76 +/- 0.08 to 0.45 +/- 0.04. The variation of both IB and
      m was partially associated with the change of properties of collagen
      fibers from the burned tissues verified by samples of tissue histological
      sections. Particularly, the m parameter may be more sensitive to
      differentiate burned skin due to the fact that it has a greater rate of
      change with respect to different burn durations. These ultrasonic
      parameters in conjunction with high-frequency B-mode and Nakagami images
      could have the potential to assess the burn degree quantitatively.

TI  - Investigating the temporal resolution limits of scintillation detection
      from pixellated elements: comparison between experiment and simulation.
PG  - 735-56
AB  - This study investigates the physical limitations involved in the
      extraction of accurate timing information from pixellated scintillation
      detectors for positron emission tomography (PET). Accurate physical
      modeling of the scintillation detection process, from scintillation light
      generation through detection, is devised and performed for varying
      detector attributes, such as the crystal element length, light yield,
      decay time and surface treatment. The dependence of light output and time
      resolution on these attributes, as well as on the photon interaction depth
      (DoI) of the annihilation quanta within the crystal volume, is studied and
      compared with experimental results. A theoretical background which
      highlights the importance of different time blurring factors for
      instantaneous ('ideal') and exponential ('realistic') scintillation decay
      is developed and compared with simulated data. For the case of a realistic
      scintillator, our experimental and simulation findings suggest that
      dependence of detector performance on DoI is more evident for crystal
      elements with rough ('as cut') compared to polished surfaces (maximum
      observed difference of 64% (25%) and 22% (19%) in simulation (measurement)
      for light output and time resolution, respectively). Furthermore we
      observe distinct trends of the detector performance dependence on detector
      element length and surface treatment. For short crystals (3 x 3 x 5 mm(3))
      an improvement in light output and time resolution for 'as cut' compared
      to polished crystals is observed (3% (7%) and 9% (9%) for simulation
      (measurement), respectively). The trend is reversed for longer crystals (3
      x 3 x 20 mm(3)) and an improvement in light output and time uncertainty
      for polished compared to 'as cut' crystals is observed (36% (6%) and 40%
      (20%) for simulation (measurement), respectively). The results of this
      study are used to guide the design of PET detectors with combined time of
      flight (ToF) and DoI features.

TI  - Understanding and evaluating platelet function.
PG  - 387-96
AB  - The contribution of platelets to normal hemostasis and vascular disease is
      well described. However, recent studies make it clear that much remains to
      be learned about platelet activation at the single cell and the molecular
      level, and about the contribution of platelets to inflammation, tumor
      angiogenesis, and embryonic development. This article is divided into two
      themes. The first is an overview of current knowledge of the mechanisms
      that drive platelet function in vivo and a brief summary of some of the
      emerging ideas that are modifying older views. The second theme is a
      consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of the tools we have as
      hematologists to assess platelet function in the clinical setting,
      identify mechanisms, and evaluate the impact of antiplatelet agents.

TI  - Immune thrombocytopenia.
PG  - 377-84
AB  - Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders
      characterized by autoimmune-mediated platelet destruction and impairment
      of thrombopoiesis. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing
      etiology (primary ITP) or secondary to a growing list of associated
      conditions (secondary ITP), and must be differentiated from other causes
      of thrombocytopenia. This review focuses on primary ITP in adults. The
      traditional goal of therapy in this population is to achieve a hemostatic
      platelet count of 30x10(9)/L or above for most patients while minimizing
      treatment-related morbidity. This approach has been called into question
      by the recent advent of well-tolerated and effective agents for the
      management of ITP, including pulse-dose dexamethasone, rituximab, and the
      thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Recent studies suggest the potential for
      aggressive therapy at the time of diagnosis to alter the natural history
      of ITP and point to the importance of quality-of-life considerations in
      therapeutic decision making.

TI  - Parenteral iron therapy in cancer-associated anemia.
PG  - 351-6
AB  - Anemia is common in cancer patients. Its cause is multifactorial, so a
      brief workup is always necessary to rule out simple, reversible causes.
      Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation and chemotherapy-induced anemia are
      the most common causes. Symptomatic or clinically severe anemia may
      require treatment with blood transfusion or an erythropoiesis-stimulating
      agent (ESA). If ESA therapy is chosen, developing evidence now suggests
      that, similar to chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis, the
      addition of intravenous iron can improve the response to ESA because of
      iron-restricted erythropoiesis, even in the iron-replete patient.

TI  - Systemic light-chain amyloidosis: advances in diagnosis, prognosis, and
      therapy.
PG  - 287-94
AB  - Systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is caused by misfolded
      immunoglobulin light-chain proteins that aggregate and deposit as unique
      fibrils, ultimately leading to organ failure and death. Recent
      developments that have significantly aided the management of patients with
      AL include diagnostic techniques for definitive typing of amyloid deposits
      by use of laser microdissection with mass spectrometry and customized
      protein bioinformatics, and validated staging and response-scoring systems
      that improve clinical trial design. The widespread use of cardiac
      biomarker staging and serum-free light-chain levels to evaluate response
      to therapy has also improved care. Standard therapies such as oral
      melphalan and dexamethasone or autologous stem cell transplant continue to
      be important options, while thalidomide and its analogs, lenalidomide and
      pomalidomide, and the proteasome-inhibitor bortezomib have activity in AL
      and have expanded our armamentarium. Continued improvement in outcomes,
      however, will require the commitment and cooperation of pharmaceutical
      companies, regulatory agencies, academic investigators, and cooperative
      groups/consortia. This effort will involve the conduct of well-designed
      clinical trials of new agents and combinations within a modern framework
      that categorizes the study populations of patients with AL, defines the
      end points appropriate to those populations and to the different phases of
      clinical trials, employs the newly available staging and response
      criteria, and standardizes adverse event reporting.

TI  - Warfarin versus new agents: interpreting the data.
PG  - 221-8
AB  - Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) is a rapidly expanding
      indication for lifelong oral anticoagulation. The vitamin K antagonists
      (VKAs) effectively prevent stroke, but are notoriously difficult to manage
      and are associated with frequent adverse events. These factors account for
      the widespread underuse of warfarin for patients with AF who are qualified
      candidates for therapy. New oral anticoagulants with different mechanisms
      of action are beginning to exit phase III trials and may replace the VKAs
      for a number of indications, especially AF. The oral direct thrombin and
      Xa inhibitors are furthest along in development. Dabigatran etexilate, a
      thrombin inhibitor, has recently shown excellent outcomes in the
      prevention of stroke in patients with AF. The oral Xa inhibitors are still
      in phase III trials for stroke prevention in AF, but results from trials
      for other indications look promising. These short-acting, short-duration,
      unmonitored drugs are not without limitations and potential adverse
      effects. The perceived drawbacks of the VKAs may actually be assets in the
      management of patients with AF, and the pros and cons of each class of
      drug must be taken into account as physicians consider or patients request
      transition to a new class of oral anticoagulants.

TI  - The present: optimizing therapy--too much or too little?
PG  - 108-14
AB  - Despite the use of less toxic chemotherapy and more limited doses and
      fields of radiation, the prognosis for patients with all stages of
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has continued to improve over the last 20
      years. The challenge today is better identification of prognostic markers
      that will allow even further reduction of therapy in the most favorable
      subsets and new approaches for those who have a high risk of failure with
      current approaches. Most ongoing clinical trials for newly diagnosed HL
      base therapy decisions on the result of an interim restaging PET/CT,
      de-escalating for early responders and escalating for patients with a
      suboptimal response. While awaiting the results of these important trials,
      the debates rage on regarding the use of consolidative radiotherapy in
      early stage HL and the use of escalated BEACOPP in advanced stage disease.
      Unfortunately, we still face the very difficult decision with nearly every
      patient with HL of &quot;too much,&quot; risking long-term consequences, or &quot;too
      little,&quot; risking relapse and the need for additional toxic therapy. At
      present, we need to make these very difficult initial treatment decisions
      with inadequate data, but reassured by the excellent outcomes for most
      patients and encouraged by the new agents available for those who fail
      first-line therapy.

TI  - Treating the elderly patient with acute myelogenous leukemia.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - Decisions regarding the optimal treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia in
      the elderly patient requires the consideration of multiple factors.
      Population-based studies have demonstrated that, for all age groups,
      aggressive therapy results in improved survival and quality of life when
      compared with palliative care. The optimal induction and postremission
      regimen for older patients has yet to be determined. Furthermore, not all
      patients are candidates for such therapy. Consideration of patient and
      disease-related factors can help to determine the appropriateness of
      intensive therapy in a given patient. For those patients for whom
      aggressive induction therapy does not seem to be in their best interest,
      novel agents are being investigated that will hopefully address the issues
      of induction death and early relapse associated with these patient
      populations.

TI  - Minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 7-12
AB  - In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), treatment response is
      increasingly evaluated with minimal residual disease (MRD) assays. ALL
      cells can be recognized by their clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin
      and T-cell receptor genes, expression of gene fusions, and
      leukemia-associated immunophenotypes. Assays based on polymerase chain
      reaction or flow cytometry can detect one ALL cell among 10,000 to 100,000
      normal cells in clinical samples. The vast majority of cases have
      antigen-receptor gene rearrangements and leukemia immunophenotypes for MRD
      monitoring; about half of the cases currently have suitable gene fusions.
      The clinical significance of MRD has been conclusively demonstrated in
      both childhood and adult ALL. In most studies, MRD positivity is defined
      by the presence of 0.01% or more ALL cells; the risk of relapse is
      generally proportional to the level of MRD, particularly when measured
      during or at the end of remission-induction therapy. The prevalence of MRD
      during early therapy differs among genetic and biologic ALL subtypes.
      However, being a measurement of drug resistance in vivo and reflecting
      multiple cellular, host, and treatment variables, MRD is typically an
      independent prognostic factor. MRD is now used in several clinical trials
      for risk assignment and to guide clinical management overall. The time
      points at which MRD testing is performed and the threshold levels that
      trigger treatment intensification vary according to the methodology
      available, the results of preclinical correlative studies, and protocol
      design.

TI  - Assessment of Subclinical Vascular Disease Associated with Ankylosing
      Spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies indicate that ankylosing spondylitis (AS), as well as
      rheumatoid arthritis, may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis
      and vascular disease. We assessed endothelial dysfunction, carotid
      atherosclerosis, and aortic stiffness in AS in context with clinical and
      laboratory measurements. METHODS: Forty-three patients with AS and 40
      matched healthy controls were studied. We assessed common carotid
      intima-media thickness (ccIMT), flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), and
      pulsewave velocity (PWV) in association with age, disease duration,
      smoking habits, body mass index, patient's assessment of pain and disease
      activity, Bath AS Disease Activity Index, Bath AS Functional Index
      (BASFI), metric measurements, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive
      protein, and HLA-B27 status. RESULTS: We found impaired FMD (6.85 +/-
      2.98% vs 8.30 +/- 3.96%; p = 0.005), increased ccIMT (0.65 +/- 0.15 vs
      0.54 +/- 0.15 mm; p = 0.01), and higher PWV (8.64 +/- 2.44 vs 8.00 +/-
      1.46 m/s; p = 0.03) in patients with AS compared to controls,
      respectively. We also found that ccIMT negatively correlated with FMD (r =
      -0.563; p = 0.0001) and positively correlated with PWV (r = 0.374; p =
      0.018). Both ccIMT and PWV correlated with disease duration (r = 0.559; p
      = 0.013 and r = 0.520; p = 0.022, respectively), BASFI (r = 0.691; p =
      0.003 and r = 0.654; p = 0.006), decreased lumbar spine mobility (r =
      -0.656; p = 0.006 and r = -0.604; p = 0.013), chest expansion (r = -0.502;
      p = 0.047 and r = -0.613; p = 0.012), and increased wall-occiput distance
      (r = 0.509; p = 0.044 and r = 0.614; p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: In this well
      characterized AS population, impaired FMD and increased ccIMT and PWV
      indicate abnormal endothelial function and increased atherosclerosis and
      aortic stiffness, respectively. The value of noninvasive diagnostic tools
      needs to be further characterized.

TI  - Increased Expression of B Cell Activation Factor Supports the Abnormal
      Expansion of Transitional B Cells in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between interferon-alpha
      (IFN-alpha) and dysregulation of B cell activation factor (BAFF) and
      specific B cell phenotypes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS:
      Four-color flow cytometry was used to examine the peripheral B cell
      populations in patients with SLE. RNA was isolated from the peripheral
      blood of 87 patients and BAFF expression was determined by quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and normalized to GAPDH. The expression
      levels of 5 IFN-responsive genes (LY 6E, OAS1, IFIT1, ISG15, and MX1) were
      determined by quantitative PCR and totaled to generate a global IFN score.
      The correlations were examined between peripheral B cell populations
      (including transitional, pregerminal, plasmablasts, and memory) and the
      expression of BAFF and the global IFN score. RESULTS: Examination of the
      peripheral B cell populations in SLE demonstrated a relative expansion of
      the transitional B cell and plasmablast compartment and a reduction in the
      memory B cell population. Expressions of BAFF and global IFN score were
      elevated in patients with SLE compared to healthy controls. A strong
      positive correlation was noted between BAFF expression and the relative
      proportion of late transitional (T2) B cells. The proportions of more
      mature B cell phenotypes did not correlate with BAFF expression. The
      global IFN score was strongly associated with the level of BAFF expression
      and moderately correlated with the proportion of late transitional B
      cells. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that elevated BAFF expression
      supports expansion of the T2 B cell compartment and contributes to a
      breach in tolerance in patients with SLE.

TI  - Plasma Platelet-derived Microparticles in Patients with Connective Tissue
      Diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the role of platelet-derived microparticles (PDMP),
      which are small vesicles with thrombotic and immunological properties, in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc),
      dermatomyositis/polymyositis (PM/DM), and mixed connective tissue disease
      (MCTD). METHODS: Plasma levels of PDMP were measured by ELISA, and
      compared among patients with one of the 4 diseases. Association of PDMP
      levels with clinical characteristics and medication of the patients was
      also examined. RESULTS: PDMP levels were higher in patients with MCTD and
      SSc than in controls. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that
      patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) showed higher PDMP levels than
      those without. PDMP levels in individual patients did not fluctuate
      significantly over several months. CONCLUSION: PDMP level is associated
      with MCTD, SSc, and RP, and could be a novel marker for RP.

TI  - Cartilage Destruction Is Partly Induced by the Internal Proteolytic
      Enzymes and Apoptotic Phenomenon of Chondrocytes in Relapsing
      Polychondritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed 9 cases by immunohistochemical studies in order to
      elucidate the mechanisms of cartilage destruction in relapsing
      polychondritis (RP), which often involves the external auricle and
      respiratory tract through immunological disorder. METHODS: Cartilage
      tissues were obtained during surgical operations. Cell species in the
      granulation tissues, especially near the cartilage, were identified by
      cell-surface markers [CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD45 (LCA), and CD68]. The
      proteolytic enzymes expressed in the cells in the perichondral granulation
      and in chondrocytes themselves were analyzed by immunohistochemical
      studies using anti-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1, -3, -8, -9, and -13,
      and cathepsin D, K, L, and elastase antibodies. Apoptosis and nitric oxide
      (NO), an apoptosis-related factor, were also examined using ApopTag and
      antinitrotyrosine antibody, respectively. RESULTS: Among cell species that
      infiltrated in perichondral granulation, LCA, CD68
      (monocytes/macrophages), and CD4 cells were dominant in number; MMP-8,
      MMP-9, and elastase were expressed only in the perichondral granulation;
      whereas MMP-3 and cathepsin K and L were detected in both chondrocytes and
      granulations. Out of 9 cases examined, 6 revealed apoptotic cells in
      excess of 50% of chondrocytes. There was a strong correlation between the
      number of apoptotic cells and the number of MMP-3-positive (r = 0.83) and
      cathepsin K-positive cells (r = 0.92). Abundant NO-expressing cells were
      observed in the chondrocytes in degenerated cartilage, similar to
      apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Cartilage destruction in polychondritis is induced
      not only by perichondral inflammation, but also by intrinsic factors
      expressed in chondrocytes themselves, including certain kinds of
      proteolytic enzymes and apoptosis.

TI  - Effect of Perilla frutescens var. acuta Kudo and rosmarinic acid on
      allergic inflammatory reactions.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - Allergy is characterized by an overreaction of the immune system. Perilla
      frutescens leaf extract has been reported to exhibit antiallergic
      inflammatory activity. To investigate precisely the effect and mechanism
      of 30% ethanol extract powder of P. frutescens var. acuta Kudo (EPPF) and
      rosmarinic acid (RA), a component of EPPF in allergic rhinitis and
      rhinoconjunctivitis, the antiallergic effects of EPPF and RA were analyzed
      using in vivo and in vitro models. Cytokine production was analyzed by
      means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine expression was
      analyzed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western
      blotting. Transcription factor and caspase-1 activity were analyzed by a
      luciferase assay and caspase-1 assay, respectively. The number of nasal,
      ear and eye rubs after an ovalbumin (OVA) challenge in OVA-sensitized mice
      was significantly higher than that in OVA-unsensitized mice. Increased
      number of rubs was inhibited by administration of EPPF or RA. Increased
      levels of IgE in the serum, spleen and nasal mucosa of OVA-sensitized mice
      were reduced by EPPF or RA administration. The histamine level was also
      reduced by EPPF or RA administration in the serum of OVA-sensitized mice.
      Protein levels and mRNA expressions of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha were inhibited by EPPF or RA administration in
      the nasal mucosa tissue or spleen of OVA-sensitized mice. In EPPF or
      RA-administered mice, the mast cell and eosinophil infiltration increase
      as caused by OVA-sensitization was decreased. In addition, EPPF or RA
      inhibited both cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression and caspase-1 activity
      in the same nasal mucosa tissue. In activated human mast cells, nuclear
      factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)/Rel A and caspase-1 activation increased,
      whereas NF-kappaB/Rel A and caspase-1 activation was inhibited after a
      treatment of EPPF or RA. These results indicate that EPPF and RA
      ameliorate allergic inflammatory reactions such as allergic rhinitis and
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

TI  - Hepatitis B x-interacting protein induces HepG2 cell proliferation through
      activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - Hepatitis B x-interacting protein (HBXIP), a co-factor of survivin, was
      originally identified by its binding with the C-terminus of the hepatitis
      B virus x protein (HBx). We have recently shown that HBXIP promotes the
      growth of both normal liver cells and hepatoma cells in vitro, but the
      molecular mechanisms of this have not been documented. In this study, we
      investigated the potential effects of HBXIP on the proliferation of HepG2
      cells and the intracellular signaling pathway mediating these changes.
      Over-expression of the HBXIP gene promoted the proliferation of HepG2
      cells, as shown by the MTT assay. We also showed that HBXIP induced
      cellular accumulation in the S phase concomitantly with up-regulation of
      cyclinD(1) and down-regulation of p21 and p53 levels. Moreover, HBXIP
      over-expression cells showed activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway; this
      activation was accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of glycogen
      synthase kinase 3beta. LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, blocked
      HBXIP-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and suppressed the cell cycle
      promotion induced by HBXIP in HepG2 cells. The increase in cyclinD(1)
      protein levels induced by HBXIP was inhibited when cells were incubated
      with LY294002. In conclusion, our data suggest that the proliferation of
      HepG2 cells promoted by HBXIP is associated with activation of the
      PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

TI  - Persistent enteric mycobacterial infection enhances sensitivity to acute
      mucosal injury.
PG  - 36-43
AB  - Antigen presenting cells such as intestinal macrophages are dynamic
      effector cells that play a critical role in maintaining mucosal
      homeostasis. However, it is not known how occult intestinal infections
      alter the response of the intestinal mucosa to subsequent intestinal
      injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate how persistent subclinical
      intestinal infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
      (Map) would influence acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-mediated
      intestinal inflammation. BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with
      Map. Following an incubation period of 90 d, mice were administered 2% DSS
      in the drinking water for six days. Prior to and during treatment with
      DSS, mice were evaluated for clinical signs of disease and body weights
      were recorded. At termination of the experiment, body weights, frequency
      of rectal blood, and gross and histological cecal lesions were evaluated,
      and tissues were collected for isolation of Map. Subclinical and
      persistent intestinal Map infection was established based on the absence
      of both weight loss and rectal blood and the isolation of Map from the
      small and large intestines in mice infected with Map only. Following
      treatment with DSS, Map-infected mice had increased weight loss, increased
      frequency of rectal blood, and exacerbation of gross lesions and increased
      cecal lesion scores. Also, there was a significant reduction in Map
      isolated from the small intestines of Map-infected and DSS-treated mice.
      In conclusion, subclinical Map infection sensitizes the host to enhanced
      acute DSS-mediated intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Cutting edge: selective role of ubiquitin in MHC class I antigen
      presentation.
PG  - 1904-8
AB  - The importance of ubiquitination in MHC class I-restricted Ag processing
      remains unclear. To address this issue, we overexpressed wild-type and
      dominant-negative lysineless forms of ubiquitin (Ub) in mammalian cells
      using an inducible vaccinia virus system. Overexpression of the lysineless
      Ub nearly abrogated polyubiquitination and potently inhibited epitope
      presentation from a cytosolic N-end rule substrate as well as endoplasmic
      reticulum (ER)-targeted model Ags. In contrast, there was little impact on
      Ag presentation from cytosolic proteins. These trends were location
      dependent; redirecting cytosolic Ag to the ER rendered presentation
      lysineless Ub-sensitive, whereas retargeting exocytic Ag to the cytosol
      had the inverse effect. This dichotomy was further underscored by small
      interfering RNA knockdown of the ER-associated Ub ligase Hrd1. Thus,
      Ub-dependent degradation appears to play a major role in the MHC class
      I-restricted processing of ER-targeted proteins and a more restricted role
      in the processing of cytosolic proteins.

TI  - Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing Nonintegrin Expression on
      M2-Polarized and Tumor-Associated Macrophages Is Macrophage-CSF Dependent
      and Enhanced by Tumor-Derived IL-6 and IL-10.
PG  - 2192-200
AB  - Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN; CD209) is a
      human pathogen-attachment C-type lectin with no obvious murine ortholog
      and for which ligation leads to enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine
      release and altered proinflammatory cytokine production. Although induced
      by IL-4 in monocytes and considered as a DC marker, DC-SIGN expression on
      human APCs under homeostatic conditions is so far unexplained. We report
      in this study that M-CSF enhances DC-SIGN expression on in vitro derived
      anti-inflammatory macrophages and that M-CSF mediates the induction of
      DC-SIGN by fibroblast- and tumor cell-conditioned media. The
      M-CSF-inducible DC-SIGN expression along monocyte-to-macrophage
      differentiation is dependent on JNK and STAT3 activation, potentiated by
      STAT3-activating cytokines (IL-6, IL-10), and abrogated by the
      M1-polarizing cytokine GM-CSF. In pathological settings, DC-SIGN
      expression is detected in tumor tissues and on ex vivo-isolated CD14(+)
      CD163(+) IL-10-producing tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly,
      DC-SIGN Abs reduced the release of IL-10 from macrophages exposed to
      Lewis(x)-expressing SKBR3 tumor cells. These results indicate that DC-SIGN
      is expressed on both wound-healing (IL-4-dependent) and regulatory
      (M-CSF-dependent) alternative (M2) macrophages and that DC-SIGN expression
      on tumor-associated macrophages might help tumor progression by
      contributing to the maintenance of an immunosuppressive environment.

TI  - Prediction of the fetal status in non-invasive management of alloimmune
      thrombocytopenia.
AB  - Fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (F/NAIT) is the most common
      cause of severe thrombocytopenia in the fetus and in an otherwise healthy
      newborn. To counter the consequences of severe fetal thrombocytopenia,
      antenatal therapies have been implemented. Predictive parameters for fetal
      severe thrombocytopenia are important for the development of non-invasive
      strategy and tailored intervention. We report here data concerning 239
      pregnancies in 75 HPA-1bb women. Analysis of the index cases (diagnosis of
      F/NAIT) did not show any significant correlation between the severity of
      the disease and the maternal genetic background (ABO blood group and
      HLA-DRB3 allele). Subsequent pregnancies were managed and therapy
      effectiveness was evaluated. The highest mean newborn platelet count was
      observed for a combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and
      steroids (135 x 10(9)/L; 54 newborns), in comparison with IVIG alone (89 x
      10(9)/L; 27 newborns). The maternal anti HPA-1a antibody concentration
      measured before any treatment and before 28 weeks of gestation was
      predictive of the fetal status. The weighted areas under curves of the
      maternal alloantibody concentrations were predictive of therapy response.
      To conclude, this large retrospective survey gives new insights on
      maternal predictive parameters for fetal status and therapy effectiveness
      allowing non-invasive strategies.

TI  - Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of bolus-infusion flavopiridol followed
      by cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone for acute leukemias.
AB  - Flavopiridol is a protein bound, cytotoxic, cyclin-dependent kinase
      inhibitor. Flavopiridol given by one hour bolus at 50 mg/m(2) daily x 3
      followed by ara-C and mitoxantrone (FLAM) is active in adults with
      poor-risk acute leukemias. A pharmacologically-derived &quot;hybrid&quot; schedule
      (30 minute bolus followed by 4 hour infusion) of flavopiridol was more
      effective than bolus administration in refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia. Our Phase I trial &quot;hybrid FLAM&quot; in 55 adults with
      relapsed/refractory acute leukemias began at a total flavopiridol dose of
      50 mg/m(2)/day x 3 (20 mg/m(2) bolus, 30 mg/m(2) infusion). Dose limiting
      toxicity occurred at level 6 (30 mg/m(2) bolus, 70 mg/m(2) infusion) with
      tumor lysis, hyperbilirubinemia and mucositis. Death occurred in 5
      patients (9%). Complete remission (CR) occurred in 22 (40%) across all
      doses. Overall and disease-free survivals for CR patients are &gt; 60% at &gt; 2
      years. Pharmacokinetics demonstrated a dose-response for total and unbound
      plasma flavopiridol unrelated to total protein, albumin, peripheral blast
      count or toxicity. Pharmacodynamically, flavopiridol inhibited mRNAs of
      multiple cell cycle regulators, but with uniform increases in bcl-2.
      &quot;Hybrid FLAM&quot; is active in relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, with a
      recommended &quot;hybrid&quot; dose of bolus 30 mg/m(2) followed by infusion 60
      mg/m(2) daily for 3 days. This clinical study is registered at
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as: #NCT00470197.

TI  - Involvement of Endothelial Apoptosis Underlying COPD-Like Phenotype in
      Adiponectin-Null Mice: Implications for Therapy.
AB  - RATIONALE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is frequently complicated
      with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and body
      weight loss, but the causal link remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To
      investigate the role of adiponectin in the pathogenesis of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease and its potential use in therapy. METHODS:
      Adiponectin localization and dynamics in the lung were analyzed in an
      elastase-induced emphysema model. Next, the lung of adiponectin-knockout
      mice, extrapulmonary effects, and the underlying mechanism were
      investigated. Finally, we tested whether exogenous adiponectin could
      ameliorate the emphysematous change in adiponectin-knockout mice.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Adiponectin expression in lung vasculature
      and plasma concentration of adiponectin were reduced after
      elastase-instillation. Notably, adiponectin-knockout mice showed
      progressive alveolar enlargement and increased lung compliance. They
      further exhibited not only systemic inflammation, but also extra-pulmonary
      phenotype such as body weight loss, fat atrophy, and osteoporosis.
      Moreover, endothelial apoptosis was enhanced in the lungs of
      adiponectin-knockout mice, as evidenced by caspase-3 activity. Consistent
      with this, expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2
      and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells
      were decreased in the adiponectin-knockout mice. Finally,
      adenovirus-mediated APN supplementation ameliorated the emphysematous
      phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin-knockout mice develop progressive
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-like phenotype with systemic
      inflammation and extra-pulmonary phenotypes. Hypoadiponectinemia could
      thus play a critical role in the progression of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease and concomitant comorbidities through endothelial
      dysfunction. Together, APN could be a novel target for chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease therapy.

TI  - Development of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, the resident
      microbiota, and the role of diet in early life.
AB  - Mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) development is guided by genetic
      determinants established during the evolution of mammals and matched to
      the natural diet and environment. Co-evolution of the host GI tract (GIT)
      and the resident bacteria has resulted in commensal relationships that are
      species and even individual specific. The interactions between the host
      and the GI bacteria are two-way and of particular importance during the
      neonatal period when the GIT needs to rapidly adapt to the external
      environment, begin processing of oral foods, and acquire the ability to
      differentiate between and react appropriately to colonizing commensal and
      potentially pathogenic bacteria. During this crucial period of life the
      patterns of gene expression that determine GI structural and functional
      development are modulated by the bacteria colonizing the previously
      sterile GIT of fetuses. The types and amounts of dietary inputs after
      birth influence GI development, species composition and metabolic
      characteristics of the resident bacteria, and the interactions that occur
      between the bacteria and the host. This review provides overviews of the
      age-related changes inGIT functions, the resident bacteria, and diet, and
      describes how interactions among these three factors influence the health
      and nutrition of neonates and can have lifelong consequences. Necrotizing
      enterocolitis is a common GI inflammatory disorder in preterm infants and
      is provided as an example of when the interactions go awry. Other enteric
      diseases are common in all newborn mammals and an understanding of the
      above interactions will enhance efforts to support neonatal health for
      infants and farm and companion animals.

TI  - Genome-wide association studies for feedlot and growth traits in cattle.
AB  - A genome wide-association study (GWAS) for production traits in cattle was
      carried out using genotype data from the 10K Affymetrix and the 50K
      Illumina SNP chips. The results for residual feed intake (RFI), body
      weight and hip height in 3 beef breed types (Bos indicus, Bos taurus and
      B.indicus x B.taurus), and for stature in dairy cattle, are presented. The
      aims were to discover SNP associated with all traits studied, but
      especially RFI, and further to test the consistency of SNP effects across
      different cattle populations and breed types. The data were analysed
      within datasets and within breed types using a mixed model and fitting 1
      SNP at a time. In each case the number of significant SNP was more than
      expected by chance alone. A total of 75 SNP from the reference population
      with 50K chip data were significant (P &lt; 0.001) for RFI, with a false
      discovery rate of 68%. These 75 SNP were mapped on 24 different bovine
      chromosomes (BTA). Of the 75 SNP, the 9 most significant SNP were detected
      on BTA 3, 5, 7 and 8 with P &lt;/= 6.0x10(-5). In a population of Angus
      cattle divergently selected for high and low RFI and 10K chip data, 111
      SNP were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) associated with RFI, with a false
      discovery rate of 7%. Approximately 103 of these SNP were therefore likely
      to represent true positives. Due to the small number of SNP common to both
      the 10K and 50K SNP chips, only 27 SNP were significantly (P &lt; 0.05)
      associated with RFI in the 2 populations. However, other chromosome
      regions were found that contained SNP significantly associated with RFI in
      both datasets although no SNP within the region showed a consistent effect
      on RFI. SNP effects were consistent between datasets only when estimated
      within the same breed type.

TI  - Atrial Tachycardia/Fibrillation in the Connexin 43 G60S Mutant
      (Oculodentodigital Dysplasia) Mouse.
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia seen in
      general practice, can be promoted by conduction slowing. Cardiac impulse
      conduction depends on gap junction channels, which are composed of
      connexins (Cxs). While atrial Cx40 and Cx43 are equally expressed, AF
      studies have primarily focused on Cx40 reductions. The G60S Cx43 mutant
      (Cx43(G60S/+)) mouse model of Oculodentodigital dysplasia has a 60%
      reduction in Cx43 in the atria. Cx43(G60S/+) mice were compared to Cx40
      deficient (Cx40-/-) mice to determine the role of Cxs in atrial
      tachycardia/fibrillation (AT/F). Intracardiac electrophysiological studies
      were done in 6-month-old male C57BL/6 Cx43(G60S/+) mutant, littermate
      (Cx43(+/+)), Cx40(-/-) and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice. AT/F induction
      used an extra stimulus during sinus rhythm, programmed electrical
      stimulation, or burst pacing (1 ms pulses, 50Hz, 400 ms train), in the
      absence and presence of carbachol (CCh). Atrial effective refractory
      periods did not differ between strains. Cx43(G60S/+) mice were more
      susceptible to induction of sustained AT/F (duration &gt;2 min, 9 of 12;
      maximum &gt;35 min) compared to Cx43(+/+) mice (3 of 11, Chi(2)=5.24,
      P=0.02). CCh enhanced sustained AT/F susceptibility in WT (from 1 of 12
      without, to 7 of 10 with CCh, Chi(2)=8.98, P&lt;0.01), but not in Cx40(-/-)
      mice (1 of 13 without vs 2 of 9 with CCh, Chi(2)=0.95, P=NS). The pattern
      of epicardial recordings during AT/F in Cx43(G60S/+) mice was left
      preceding right, with left atrial fractionated activation patterns
      consistent with clinical observations of AF. Conclusions: While
      Cx43(G60S/+) mice had severe AT/F, Cx40(-/-) mice were resistant to
      carbachol induced AT/F.

TI  - Acute antioxidant supplementation and skeletal muscle vascular conductance
      in aged rats: role of exercise and fiber type.
AB  - Age-related increases in oxidative stress contribute to impaired skeletal
      muscle vascular control. However, recent evidence indicates that
      antioxidant treatment with tempol
      (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) attenuates flow-mediated
      vasodilation in isolated arterioles from the highly oxidative soleus
      muscle of aged rats. Whether antioxidant treatment with tempol evokes
      similar responses in vivo at rest and during exercise in senescent
      individuals and whether this effect varies based on muscle fiber type
      composition is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that redox modulation via
      acute systemic tempol administration decreases vascular conductance (VC)
      primarily in oxidative hindlimb locomotor muscles at rest and during
      submaximal whole-body exercise (treadmill running at 20 mmin(-1), 5%
      grade) in aged rats. Eighteen old (25-26 mo) male Fischer 344 x Brown
      Norway rats were assigned to either rest (n=8) or exercise (n=10) groups.
      Regional VC was determined via radiolabelled microspheres before and after
      intra-arterial administration of tempol (302 mumolkg(-1)). Tempol
      decreased mean arterial pressure significantly by 9% at rest and 16%
      during exercise. At rest, similar VC in 26 out of 28 individual hindlimb
      muscles or muscle parts following tempol administration compared to
      control resulted in unchanged total hindlimb muscle VC (control:
      0.18+/-0.02; tempol: 0.17+/-0.05 mLmin(-1)100g(-1)mmHg(-1); P&gt;0.05).
      During exercise, all individual hindlimb muscles or muscle parts
      irrespective of fiber type composition exhibited either an increase or no
      change in VC with tempol (i.e.,  upward arrow11 and &lt;--&gt;17 muscles or
      muscle parts), such that total hindlimb VC increased by 25% (control:
      0.93+/-0.04; tempol: 1.15+/-0.09 mLmin(-1).100g(-1)mmHg(-1); P&lt;/=0.05).
      These results demonstrate that acute systemic administration of the
      antioxidant tempol impacts significantly the control of regional vascular
      tone in vivo presumably via redox modulation and improves skeletal muscle
      vasodilation independently of fiber type composition during submaximal
      whole-body exercise in aged rats.

TI  - Depletion of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein in bloodstream form
      Trypanosoma brucei causes a kinetoplast segregation defect.
AB  - Like other eukaryotes, trypanosomes have an essential type II fatty acid
      synthase in their mitochondrion. We have investigated the function of this
      synthase in bloodstream form parasites by studying the effect of a
      conditional knockout of acyl carrier protein (ACP), a key player in this
      fatty acid synthase pathway. We found that ACP depletion caused not only
      small changes in cellular phospholipids, but it also, surprisingly, caused
      changes in the kinetoplast. This structure, which contains the
      mitochondrial genome in the form of a giant network of several thousand
      interlocked DNA rings (kinetoplast DNA or kDNA), became larger in some
      cells and smaller or absent in others. We observed the same pattern in
      isolated networks, viewed either by fluorescence or electron microscopy.
      We found that the changes in kDNA size are not due to the disruption of
      replication, but instead, a defect in segregation. kDNA segregation is
      mediated by the tripartite attachment complex (TAC) and we hypothesize
      that one of the TAC components, a differentiated region of the
      mitochondrial double membrane, has an altered phospholipid composition
      when ACP is depleted. We further speculate that this compositional change
      affects TAC function and thus, kDNA segregation.

TI  - Tracking glideosome-associated protein-50 reveals the development and
      organization of the inner membrane complex of P. falciparum.
AB  - The most deadly of the human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, has
      different stages specialized for invasion of hepatocytes, erythrocytes and
      the mosquito gut wall. In each case host cell invasion is powered by an
      actin/myosin motor complex that is linked to an inner membrane complex
      (IMC) via a membrane anchor called the glideosome-associated protein-50
      (PfGAP50). We have generated P. falciparum transfectants expressing green
      fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of PfGAP50. Using immunoprecipitation
      and fluorescence photobleaching we show that C-terminally tagged
      PfGAP50-GFP can form a complex with endogenous copies of the linker
      protein, PfGAP45, and the Myosin A Tail Domain Interacting Protein (MTIP).
      Full-length PfGAP50-GFP is located in the endoplasmic reticulum in early
      stage parasites, then redistributes to apical caps during the formation of
      daughter merozoites. In the final stage of schizogony the PfGAP50-GFP
      profile extends further around the merozoite surface. 3D-Structured
      Illumination Microscopy reveals the early stage IMC as a doubly punctured
      flat ellipsoid that separates to form claw-shaped apposed structures. A
      GFP fusion of PfGAP50 lacking the C-terminal membrane anchor is
      misdirected to the parasitophorous vacuole. Replacement of the acid
      phosphatase homology domain of PfGAP50 with GFP appears to allow correct
      trafficking of the chimera but confers a growth disadvantage.

TI  - Research resource: nuclear receptor atlas of human retinal pigment
      epithelial cells: potential relevance to age-related macular degeneration.
PG  - 360-72
AB  - Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells play a vital role in retinal
      physiology by forming the outer blood-retina barrier and supporting
      photoreceptor function. Retinopathies including age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) involve physiological and pathological changes in the
      epithelium, severely impairing the retina and effecting vision. Nuclear
      receptors (NRs), including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and
      liver X receptor, have been identified as key regulators of physiological
      pathways such as lipid metabolic dysregulation and inflammation, pathways
      that may also be involved in development of AMD. However, the expression
      levels of NRs in RPE cells have yet to be systematically surveyed.
      Furthermore, cell culture lines are widely used to study the biology of
      RPE cells, without knowledge of the differences or similarities in NR
      expression and activity between these in vitro models and in vivo RPE.
      Using quantitative real-time PCR, we assessed the expression patterns of
      all 48 members of the NR family plus aryl hydrocarbon receptor and aryl
      hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator in human RPE cells. We profiled
      freshly isolated cells from donor eyes (in vivo), a spontaneously arising
      human cell line (in vitro), and primary cell culture lines (in vitro) to
      determine the extent to which NR expression in the cultured cell lines
      reflects that of in vivo. To evaluate the validity of using cell culture
      models for investigating NR receptor biology, we determined
      transcriptional activity and target gene expression of several moderately
      and highly expressed NRs in vitro. Finally, we identified a subset of NRs
      that may play an important role in pathobiology of AMD.

TI  - Nr4a1 siRNA expression attenuates alpha-MSH regulated gene expression in
      3T3-L1 adipocytes.
PG  - 291-306
AB  - Several recent investigations have underscored the growing role of
      melanocortin signaling in the peripheral regulation of lipid, glucose, and
      energy homeostasis. In addition, the melanocortins play a critical role in
      the central control of satiety. These observations, and the latest reports
      highlighting the emerging role of the nuclear hormone receptor (NR) 4A
      subgroup in metabolism, have prompted us to investigate the cross talk
      between [Nle(4), d-Phe(7)] (NDP)-alpha-MSH and Nr4a signaling in adipose.
      We have shown that NDP-MSH strikingly and preferentially induces the
      expression of the NR4A subgroup (but not any other members of the NR
      superfamily) in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Utilization of
      quantitative PCR on custom-designed metabolic TaqMan low-density arrays
      identified the concomitant and marked induction of the mRNAs encoding
      Il-6, Cox2, Pdk4, and Pck-1 after NDP-MSH treatment. Similar experiments
      demonstrated that the mRNA expression profile induced by cAMP and NDP-MSH
      treatment displayed unique but also overlapping properties and suggested
      that melanocortin-mediated induction of gene expression involves
      cAMP-dependent and -independent signaling. Nr4a1/Nur77 small interfering
      RNA (siRNA) expression suppressed NDP-MSH-mediated induction of
      Nr4a1/Nur77 and Nr4a3/Nor-1 (but not Nr4a2/Nurr1). Moreover, expression of
      the siRNA-attenuated NDP-MSH mediated induction of the mRNAs encoding
      Il-6, Cox2/Ptgs2, and Pck-1 expression. In addition, Nur77 siRNA
      expression attenuated NDP-MSH-mediated glucose uptake. In vivo, ip
      administration of NDP-MSH to C57 BL/6J (male) mice significantly induced
      the expression of the mRNA encoding Nur77 and increased IL-6, Cox2, Pck1,
      and Pdk4 mRNA expression in (inguinal) adipose tissue. We conclude that
      Nur77 expression is necessary for MSH-mediated induction of gene
      expression in differentiated adipocytes. Furthermore, this study
      demonstrates cross talk between MSH and Nr4a signaling in adipocytes.

TI  - Glucocorticoid-Mediated Repression of the Oncogenic microRNA Cluster
      miR-17~92 Contributes to the Induction of Bim and Initiation of Apoptosis.
AB  - Synthetic glucocorticoids were one of the first effective treatments for
      lymphoid malignancies because of their ability to induce apoptosis and are
      still used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
      Up-regulation of Bim, a proapoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma-2
      family, is an important mediator of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.
      Although glucocorticoids are known to elevate Bim mRNA and protein, little
      is known about the mechanism. Here, we report that glucocorticoids repress
      the expression of the microRNA cluster miR-17~92, which results in
      elevated Bim protein expression as a mechanism by which glucocorticoids
      induce Bim. Using a luciferase-Bim 3' untranslated region construct, we
      demonstrate that glucocorticoids mediate Bim induction
      posttranscriptionally after miR-17~92 repression, resulting in increased
      Bim protein expression. Overexpression of miR-17~92 microRNAs decreases
      Bim induction and attenuates glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis.
      Conversely, knockdown of miR-17~92 increases Bim protein expression and
      glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis. These findings indicate that endogenous
      levels of miR-17~92 repress Bim expression in T-cell lymphoid malignancies
      and that glucocorticoids induce Bim expression via down-regulation of the
      miR-17~92 microRNA cluster. Our findings present a novel mechanism that
      contributes to the up-regulation of Bim and induction of apoptosis in
      lymphocytes after glucocorticoid treatment. Furthermore, our work

TI  - Neonatal Hyperoxia Contributes Additively to Cigarette Smoke-induced COPD
      Changes in Adult Mice.
AB  - The extent by which an early postnatal lung injury can contribute to the
      development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the adult
      is unclear. We hypothesized that exposure to hyperoxia during early
      postnatal life can augment lung changes caused by adult chronic cigarette
      smoke (CS) exposure. Methods: One-day old C57BL/6J mice were exposed to
      hyperoxia (O2) for five days. At one month of age, half of the O2 exposed
      mice and half of the control mice were placed in a CS chamber for six
      months. Following exposure to CS, mice underwent quasi-static
      pressure-volume curve and mean chord length measurements (MCL),
      quantification of pro-Sp-c expression and measurement of lung IL-8/ KC,
      CXCR2/IL8Ralpha, TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA by real time PCR. Results: The O2
      +CS adult mice had significantly larger MCLs (p&lt;0.02), and lung volumes at
      35 cm H2O (p&lt;0.05) compared to all other groups. They also had
      significantly less pro-Sp-c protein and SPC mRNA expression (p&lt;0.003). The
      O2 +CS and CS only mice had significantly higher lung resistance and
      longer mean time constants (p&lt;0.01), significantly more inflammatory cells
      in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (p&lt;0.03) and significantly
      higher levels of lung CXCR2/ IL8Ralpha mRNA compared to mice not exposed
      to smoke (p&lt;0.02). Conclusion: Exposure to early postnatal hyperoxia
      contributed additively to CS-induced COPD changes in adult mice. These
      results may be relevant to a growing population of preterm children who
      sustained lung injury in the newborn period and may be exposed to
      cigarette smoke in later life.

TI  - Early victims of X-rays: a tribute and current perception.
PG  - 123-5
AB  - X-rays were discovered in 1895 and since then much has been written about
      Wilhelm Roentgen and the events surrounding the discovery. However, there
      have been only scattered references in the literature about the early
      workers who dedicated their life, and death, to X-rays. Radiology has come
      of age since then. Large exposure times have been reduced to milliseconds
      and there has been a change from analogue to digital. The advent of new
      and rapidly developing modalities and the ubiquitous presence of cone beam
      CT (CBCT) highlight the need to remember the early victims of X-rays,
      especially with the lack of universal guidelines for taking a CBCT scan.
      The aim of this article is to alert the oral radiologist to exposing
      patients irrespective of need, and to pay respect to the victims on the
      116(th) anniversary of the discovery of X-rays.

TI  - Persistent infection or successive re-infection of deer mice with
      Bartonella vinsonii subsp. arupensis.
AB  - Bartonella infections are common in rodents. From 1994-2006, longitudinal
      studies of a rodent community, mainly consisting of deer mice (Peromyscus
      maniculatus), were conducted in southwestern Colorado to study
      hantaviruses. Blood samples from deer mice captured one or more times
      during the period 2003-2006 (n=737) were selected to study bartonellae in
      deer mice. Bartonellae were found to be widely distributed in that
      population, with an overall prevalence of 82.4% (607/737). No correlation
      was found between bartonella prevalence and deer mouse weight or sex.
      Persistent or successive infections with bartonellae were observed in deer
      mice captured repeatedly, with a prevalence of 83.9% (297/354), and the
      infection appeared to last for more than one year in some of them.
      Persistent infection with bartonellae could explain the high prevalence of
      these bacteria in deer mice at this site and, perhaps, elsewhere. Genetic
      analysis demonstrated that deer mouse-borne bartonella isolates at this
      site belong to the same species, B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis,
      demonstrating a specific relationship between B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis
      and deer mice.

TI  - Comprehensive Approaches for Molecular Biomarker Discovery for the
      Detection and Identification of Cronobacter spp. (Enterobacter sakazakii)
      and Salmonella.
AB  - Cronobacter spp. (formerly Enterobacter sakazakii) and Salmonella are
      increasingly implicated internationally as important microbiological
      contaminants in low-moisture food products, including powdered infant
      formula. Estimates indicate that 40-80% of infants infected with
      Cronobacter sakazakii and/or Salmonella in the U.S. may not survive the
      illness. A systematic approach, combining literature-based data mining,
      comparative genome analysis, and the direct sequencing of PCR products of
      specific biomarker genes was used to construct an initial collection of
      genes to be targeted. These targeted genes, particularly genes encoding
      for virulence factors and genes responsible for unique phenotypes, have
      the potential to function as biomarker genes for the identification and
      differentiation of Cronobacter spp. and Salmonella from other food-borne
      pathogens in low-moisture food products. In this paper, a total of 58
      unique Salmonella gene clusters and 126 unique potential Cronobacter spp.
      biomarkers and putative virulence factors were identified. A chitinase
      gene, a well-studied virulence factor in fungi, plants, and bacteria, was
      used to confirm this approach. We found that the chitinase gene has very
      low sequence variability and/or polymorphism among Cronobacter spp.,
      Citrobacter, and Salmonella, while differing significantly in other
      food-borne pathogens, either by sequence blasting or experimental testing,
      including PCR amplification and direct sequencing. However, this
      computational analysis for Cronobacter spp. and Salmonella biomarker
      identification and the preliminary laboratory studies are only a starting
      point; thus PCR and array-based biomarker verification studies in other
      food-borne pathogens are currently being conducted.

TI  - CTGF Disrupts Alveolarization and Induces Pulmonary Hypertension in
      Neonatal Mice: Implication in the Pathogenesis of Severe Bronchopulmonary
      Dysplasia.
AB  - The pathological hallmarks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), one of the
      most common long-term pulmonary complications associated with preterm
      birth, include arrested alveolarization, abnormal vascular growth and
      variable interstitial fibrosis. Severe BPD is often complicated by
      pulmonary hypertension characterized by excessive pulmonary vascular
      remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy that significantly
      contributes to the mortality and morbidity of these infants. Connective
      tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a multifunctional protein that coordinates
      complex biological processes during tissue development and remodeling. We
      have previously shown that conditional overexpression of CTGF in airway
      epithelium under the control of the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)
      promoter results in BPD-like architecture in neonatal mice. In this study,
      we have generated a doxycyclin-inducible double transgenic mouse model
      with overexpression of CTGF in alveolar type II epithelial (AT II) cells
      under the control of the surfactant protein C (SP-C) promoter.
      Overexpression of CTGF in neonatal mice caused dramatic macrophage and
      neutrophil infiltration in alveolar airspaces and perivascular regions.
      Overexpression of CTGF also significantly decreased alveolarization and
      vascular development. Furthermore, overexpression of CTGF induced
      pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Most
      importantly, we have also demonstrated that these pathological changes are
      associated with activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/glucose
      synthesis kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta)/beta-catenin signaling. These data
      indicate that overexpression of CTGF in AT II cells results in lung
      pathology similar to those observed in infants with severe BPD, and that
      ILK/ GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling may play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of severe BPD.

TI  - LUNG-DERIVED SOLUBLE MEDIATORS ARE PATHOGENIC IN VENTILATOR-INDUCED LUNG
      INJURY.
AB  - Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) due to high tidal volume (V(T)) is
      associated with increased levels of circulating factors, which may
      contribute to or be markers of injury. This study investigated if
      exclusively lung-derived circulating factors produced during high V(T)
      ventilation can cause or worsen VILI. In isolated perfused mouse lungs,
      recirculation of perfusate worsened injury (compliance impairment,
      microvascular permeability, edema) induced by high V(T). Perfusate
      collected from lungs ventilated with high V(T) and used to perfuse lungs
      ventilated with low V(T) caused similar compliance impairment and
      permeability, and caused a dose-dependent decrease in transepithelial
      electrical resistance (TER) across rat distal lung epithelial monolayers.
      Circulating soluble factors derived from the isolated lung thus
      contributed to VILI and had deleterious effects on the lung epithelial
      barrier. This data demonstrates transferability of an injury initially
      caused exclusively by mechanical ventilation and provides novel evidence
      for the biotrauma hypothesis in VILI. Mediators of the TER decrease were
      heat-sensitive, transferable via Folch extraction, and (following
      ultrafiltration, 3 kDa) comprised both smaller and larger molecules.
      Although several classes of candidate mediators including protein
      cytokines (e.g. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Interleukin-6, Macrophage
      inflammation protein-1alpha) and lipids (e.g. eicosanoids, ceramides,
      sphingolipids) have been implicated in VILI, only prostanoids accumulated
      in the perfusate in a pattern consistent with a pathogenic role, yet
      cyclooxygenase inhibition did not protect against injury. Although no
      single class of factor appears solely responsible for the decrease in
      barrier function, the current data implicate lipid-soluble protein-bound
      molecules as not just markers, but pathogenic mediators in VILI.

TI  - RSK4 Inhibition Results in Bypass of Stress-Induced and Oncogene-Induced
      Senescence.
AB  - RSK4 is a serine-threonine kinase that belongs to the p90RSK family. RSK4
      has been proposed as a tumour suppressor gene, related with anti-invasive
      activity, inhibition of the RAS-MAPK pathway, and induction of senescence.
      Despite the related findings, little is known about RSK4 effectors. In
      human tumors, RSK4 is downregulated even in some benign lesions, such as
      colon adenomas and breast papillomas, indicating that RSK4 inhibition
      could be an early event in cellular transformation. For cells to achieve
      immortality and transformation, it is believed that they must override
      senescence. In the present study, we found that when RSK4 is inhibited in
      vitro using shRNA technology, cells can bypass stress-induced senescence
      and oncogene-induced senescence: normal human fibroblasts grew following
      oxidative stress, induction of DNA damage, and KRAS(V12) or BRAF(E600)
      overexpression. To investigate the RSK4 effectors, we used shRNA or
      inhibitor molecules against major senescence mediators. We found that
      RSK4-induced senescence is mediated through p21, but is independent of
      p16, p38MAPKs, and induction of reactive oxygen species, delimiting RSK4
      signaling. These data support the importance of RSK4 for regulating
      senescence and indicate that downregulation of this kinase could be an
      important element in facilitating cell transformation.

TI  - Interaction between Testosterone and Growth Hormone on Whole-Body Protein
      Anabolism Occurs in the Liver.
AB  - Context: GH and testosterone both exert protein-anabolic effects and may
      act synergistically. Liver and muscle are major sites of protein
      metabolism. Objective: Our objective was to determine whether the site of
      GH and testosterone interaction on protein metabolism is primarily hepatic
      or extrahepatic. Design: In this open-label randomized crossover study,
      the impact on whole-body protein metabolism of oral (solely hepatic
      testosterone exposure) and transdermal (systemic testosterone exposure)
      testosterone replacement in the presence or absence of GH was compared.
      Patients and Intervention: Eleven hypopituitary men with GH and
      testosterone deficiency were randomized to 2-wk treatments with
      transdermal testosterone (10 mg) or oral testosterone (40 mg), with or
      without GH replacement (0.6 mg/d). The dose of testosterone administered
      orally achieves physiological portal testosterone concentrations without
      spillover into the systemic circulation. Main Outcome Measures: Whole-body
      leucine turnover was measured, from which leucine rate of appearance
      (LRa), an index of protein breakdown, and leucine oxidation (Lox), a
      measure of irreversible protein loss, were estimated at the end of each
      treatment. Results: In the absence of GH, neither transdermal nor oral
      testosterone affected LRa or Lox. GH therapy significantly increased LRa,
      an effect equally reduced by transdermal and oral testosterone
      administration. GH replacement alone did not significantly change Lox,
      whereas addition of testosterone treatment reduced Lox, with the effect
      not significantly different between transdermal and oral testosterone.
      Conclusion: In the doses used, testosterone stimulates protein anabolism
      by reducing protein breakdownandoxidation only in the presence ofGH.
      Because the net effectonprotein metabolism during GH therapy is not
      different between systemic and solely hepatic testosterone administration,
      we conclude that the liver is the primary site of this hormonal
      interaction.

TI  - Surgical Results of Thyroid Nodules according to a Management Guideline
      Based on the BRAFV600E Mutation Status.
AB  - Context: In Korea, where PTC comprises about 90-95% of the reported
      thyroid cancers, the prevalence of BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary
      thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is above 80%. Objective: We analyzed the surgical
      result according to a management guideline based on the BRAF(V600E)
      mutation status of thyroid nodules. Design: A total of 865 thyroid nodules
      were prospectively analyzed for their cytology and BRAF(V600E) mutation
      status by pyrosequencing. For the patients who had a diagnosis of atypical
      cells of undetermined significance (ACUS), we recommended surgery when
      there was positivity for BRAF(V600E) mutation or the nodules were
      clinically suspicious. Results: Among 865 cases, 504, 141, 54, 140, 10,
      and 16 were diagnosed as benign, ACUS, suspicious for malignancy,
      malignant, suspicious for follicular neoplasm, and nondiagnostic,
      respectively. None of the 504 benign, 45 (31.9%) of the 141 ACUS, 46
      (85.2%) of the 54 suspicious for malignancy, 129 (92.1%) of the 140
      malignant, and one (10%) of the 10 suspicious for follicular neoplasm
      cases showed BRAF(V600E) mutation. Surgery was recommended to all 45
      patients with BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive ACUS nodules; among them, 30
      patients underwent surgery, 29 had PTC, and one had nodular hyperplasia.
      All the patients diagnosed as suspicious for malignancy or malignant were
      advised to undergo an operation, and they turned out to have PTCs
      regardless of their BRAF(V600E) mutation status. Conclusions: We found
      that performing BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis on the fine-needle
      aspiration biopsy specimens was of great help to make a therapeutic
      decision for thyroid nodules when the fine-needle aspiration biopsy
      results were equivocal.

TI  - SHBG, Sex Hormones, and Inflammatory Markers in Older Women.
AB  - Context: In premenopausal and older women, high testosterone and estradiol
      (E2) and low SHBG levels are associated with insulin resistance and
      diabetes, conditions characterized by low-grade inflammation. Objective:
      The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between SHBG, total
      testosterone, total E2, and inflammatory markers in older women. Design
      and Patients: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of 433
      women at least 65 yr old from the InCHIANTI Study, Italy, who were not on
      hormone replacement therapy or recently hospitalized and who had complete
      data on SHBG, testosterone, E2, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, soluble
      IL-6 receptor (sIL-6r), and TNF-alpha. Relationships between sex hormones
      and inflammatory markers were examined by multivariate linear regression
      analyses adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, insulin, physical
      activity, and chronic disease. Results: In fully adjusted analyses, SHBG
      was negatively associated with CRP (P = 0.007), IL-6 (P = 0.008), and
      sIL-6r (P = 0.02). In addition, testosterone was positively associated
      with CRP (P = 0.006), IL-6 (P = 0.001), and TNF-alpha (P = 0.0002). The
      negative relationship between testosterone and sIL-6r in an age-adjusted
      model (P = 0.02) was no longer significant in a fully adjusted model (P =
      0.12). E2 was positively associated with CRP (P = 0.002) but not with IL-6
      in fully adjusted models. In a final model including E2, testosterone, and
      SHBG, and all the confounders previously considered, SHBG (0.23 +/- 0.08;
      P = 0.006) and E2 (0.21 +/- 0.08; P = 0.007), but not testosterone (P =
      0.21), were still significantly associated with CRP. Conclusion: In late
      postmenopausal women not on hormone replacement therapy, SHBG and E2 are,
      respectively, negative and positive, independent and significant
      correlates of a proinflammatory state.

TI  - H3K36 methylation antagonizes PRC2 mediated H3K27 methylation.
AB  - H3K27 methylation mediated by the histone methyltransferase complex PRC2
      is critical for transcriptional regulation, Polycomb silencing, Drosophila
      segmentation, mammalian X chromosome inactivation and cancer.
      PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation can spread along the chromatin and
      propagate the repressive chromatin environment; thus, chromatin components
      that antagonize PRC2's activity are important for restraining Polycomb
      silencing. Here we report that in HeLa cells, H3 histones unmethylated at
      K36 are mostly methylated at K27, with the exception of newly synthesized
      H3. In addition, K27me3 rarely co-exists with K36me2 or K36me3 on the same
      histone H3 polypeptide. Moreover, PRC2 activity is greatly inhibited on
      nucleosomal substrates with pre-installed H3K36 methylation. These
      findings collectively identify H3K36 methylation as a chromatin component
      that restricts the PRC2-mediated spread of H3K27 methylation. Finally, we
      provide evidence that the controversial histone lysine methyltransferase
      Ash1, a known Trithorax group protein that antagonizes Polycomb silencing
      in vivo, is an H3K36-specific dimethylase, not an H3K4 methylase, further
      supporting the role of H3K36 methylation in antagonizing PRC2-mediated
      H3K27 methylation.

TI  - Presenilins promote the cellular uptake of copper and zinc and maintain
      Cu-chaperone of sod1-dependent Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase activity.
AB  - Dyshomeostasis of extracellular zinc and copper has been implicated in
      beta-amyloid aggregation, the major pathology associated with Alzheimer's
      disease. Presenilin mediates the proteolytic cleavage of the beta-amyloid
      precursor protein to release beta-amyloid and mutations in presenilin can
      cause familial Alzheimer's disease. We tested whether presenilin
      expression affects copper and zinc transport. Studying murine embryonic
      fibroblasts (MEFs) from presenilin knockout mice or RNA interference of
      presenilin expression in HEK293T cells, we observed a marked decrease in
      saturable uptake of radiolabeled copper and zinc. Measurement of basal
      metal levels in six month old presenilin 1 heterozygous knockout (PS1+/-)
      mice revealed significant deficiencies of copper and zinc in several
      tissues, including brain. Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activity was
      significantly decreased in both presenilin knockout MEFs and brain tissue
      of presenilin 1 heterozygous knockout mice. In the MEFs and PS1+/- brains
      Cu-chaperone of SOD1 levels were decreased. Zinc-dependent alkaline
      phosphatase activity was not decreased in the PS null MEFs. These data
      indicate that presenilins are important for cellular copper and zinc
      turnover, influencing SOD1 activity, and having the potential to
      indirectly impact beta-amyloid aggregation through metal ion clearance.

TI  - Arginine deficiency causes runting in the suckling period by selectively
      activating the stress kinase GCN2.
AB  - Suckling 'F/A2' mice, which overexpress arginase-I in their enterocytes,
      develop a syndrome (hypoargininemia, reduced hair and muscle growth,
      impaired B-cell maturation) that resembles IGF1 deficiency. The syndrome
      may result from an impaired function of the GH-IGF1-axis, activation of
      the stress-kinase GCN2, and/or blocking of the mTORC1-signaling pathway.
      Arginine deficiency inhibited GH secretion and decreased liver Igf1 mRNA
      and plasma IGF1 concentration, but did not change muscle IGF1
      concentration. GH supplementation induced Igf1 mRNA synthesis, but did not
      restore growth, ruling out direct involvement of the GH-IGF1 axis. In
      C2C12 muscle cells, arginine withdrawal activated GCN2 signaling, without
      impacting mTORC1 signaling. In F/A2 mice, the reduction of plasma and
      tissue arginine concentrations to ~25% of wild-type values activated GCN2
      signaling, but mTORC1-mediated signaling remained unaffected.
      Gcn2-deficient F/A2 mice suffered from hypoglycemia and died shortly after
      birth. Since common targets of all stress kinases (eIF2alpha
      phosphorylation, Chop mRNA expression) were not increased in these mice,
      the effects of arginine deficiency were solely mediated by GCN2.

TI  - Fenvalerate induced hepatic oxidative stress in selenium- and/or
      iodine-deficient rats.
AB  - Considering the potential adverse effects of selenium and iodine
      deficiencies, and frequency of intensive but improper use of insecticides,
      this study was designed to evaluate the effects of a pyrethroid
      insecticide, fenvalerate, on the oxidant/antioxidant status of liver using
      a rat model of iodine and/or selenium deficiency. The study was conducted
      on eight groups of 3-week old Wistar rats. Iodine and/or selenium
      deficiency was introduced by feeding the animals with a diet containing
      &lt;0.005 mg selenium/kg and/or supplying with 1% sodium perchlorate
      containing drinking water for a period of 7 weeks. Fenvalerate exposure
      (100 mg/kg/d, i.p., for the last 7 days) in normal rats increased hepatic
      glutathione peroxidase activity and lipid peroxidation, decreased
      glutathione content, but did not change the activities of catalase or any
      of the superoxide dismutase forms; in iodine-deficient animals caused only
      the elevation of lipid peroxidation; in selenium-deficient animals and in
      combined iodine/selenium deficiency decreased glutathione peroxidase,
      increased catalase activities and lipid peroxidation, and decreased all
      the forms of superoxide dismutase activity only in combined deficiency.
      These results suggested that fenvalerate is an oxidant stress inducer in
      rat liver, and its potential effects on pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance
      may also be important for human populations, particularly with iodine
      and/or selenium deficiencies.

TI  - CCT241533 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CHK2 that potentiates the
      cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors.
PG  - 463-72
AB  - CHK2 is a checkpoint kinase involved in the ATM-mediated response to
      double-strand DNA breaks. Its potential as a drug target is still unclear,
      but inhibitors of CHK2 may increase the efficacy of genotoxic cancer
      therapies in a p53 mutant background by eliminating one of the checkpoints
      or DNA repair pathways contributing to cellular resistance. We report here
      the identification and characterization of a novel CHK2 kinase inhibitor,
      CCT241533. X-ray crystallography confirmed that CCT241533 bound to CHK2 in
      the ATP pocket. This compound inhibits CHK2 with an IC(50) of 3 nmol/L and
      shows minimal cross-reactivity against a panel of kinases at 1 mumol/L.
      CCT241533 blocked CHK2 activity in human tumor cell lines in response to
      DNA damage, as shown by inhibition of CHK2 autophosphorylation at S516,
      band shift mobility changes, and HDMX degradation. CCT241533 did not
      potentiate the cytotoxicity of a selection of genotoxic agents in several
      cell lines. However, this compound significantly potentiates the
      cytotoxicity of two structurally distinct PARP inhibitors. Clear induction
      of the pS516 CHK2 signal was seen with a PARP inhibitor alone, and this
      activation was abolished by CCT241533, implying that the potentiation of
      PARP inhibitor cell killing by CCT241533 was due to inhibition of CHK2.
      Consequently, our findings imply that CHK2 inhibitors may exert
      therapeutic activity in combination with PARP inhibitors.

      Studies on the LPS action both in vivo and in vitro have used different
      preparations of LPS, including ultra-pure LPS (LIST) and a less pure but
      less expensive form (Sigma) isolated from Escherichia coli serotype
      O111:B4. The difference between the effects of these compounds has not
      been well studied although this information is important in understanding
      TLR stimulation. In this study, we compared response of RAW264.7
      macrophage cells treated LIST or Sigma LPS for 6 h and 24 h. Gene
      expression data were analyzed to identify specific genes and pathways that
      are in common and unique to the two LPS preparations. Seven hundred
      fifty-five genes were differentially expressed at 6 h in response to Sigma
      LPS and 973 were differentially expressed following LIST LPS treatment,
      with 503 in common. At 24 h, Sigma LPS induced or repressed 901 genes
      while 1646 genes were differentially regulated by LIST LPS treatment; 701
      genes were shared by two forms of LPS. Although considerably more genes
      were differentially expressed in response to LIST LPS, similar molecular
      pathways and transcriptional networks were activated by the two LPS
      preparations. We also treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from
      three strains of mice with different concentrations of LIST and Sigma LPS
      and showed that BMMs produced more IL-6 and TNF-alpha in response to LIST
      LPS at low LPS concentrations but, at higher LPS concentrations, more
      cytokines were produced in response to stimulation by Sigma LPS. Together,
      these findings suggest that, despite activation of similar molecular
      pathways by LIST and Sigma LPS preparations, residual protein impurities
      in the Sigma LPS preparation may nevertheless influence the
      transcriptional profile attributed to TLR4 stimulation.

TI  - Protease-activated receptor 2 activation promotes an anti-inflammatory and
      alternatively activated phenotype in LPS-stimulated murine macrophages.
AB  - Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)), a 7-transmembrane G
      protein-coupled receptor, contributes to inflammation either positively or
      negatively in different experimental systems. Previously, we reported that
      concurrent activation of PAR(2) and TLRs in human lung and colonic
      epithelial cells resulted in a synergistic increase in NF-kappaB-mediated
      gene expression, but a down-regulation of IRF-3-mediated gene expression.
      In this study, the effect of PAR(2) activation on LPS-induced TLR4
      signaling was examined in primary murine macrophages. The PAR(2)
      activation of wild-type macrophages enhanced LPS-induced expression of the
      anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, while suppressing gene expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12. Similar
      PAR(2)-mediated effects on LPS-stimulated IL-10 and IL-12 mRNA were also
      observed in vivo. In contrast, PAR(2) (-/-) macrophages exhibited
      diminished LPS-induced IL-10 mRNA and protein expression and downstream
      STAT3 activation, but increased KC mRNA and protein. PAR(2) activation
      also enhanced both rIL-4- and LPS-induced secretion of IL-4 and IL-13, and
      mRNA expression of alternatively activated macrophage (AA-Mvarphi)
      markers, e.g. arginase-1, mannose receptor, Ym-1. Thus, in the context of
      a potent inflammatory stimulus like LPS, PAR(2) activation acts to
      re-establish tissue homeostasis by dampening the production of
      inflammatory mediators and causing the differentiation of macrophages that
      may contribute to the development of a Th2 response.

TI  - Left ventricular myxoma in a child: a case report.
AB  - Left ventricular myxoma are quite rare and have not been reported in
      children. We report a left ventricular myxoma arising from
      interventricular septum in a 12-year-old girl who presented with history
      of single episode of syncope while playing in school. General examination
      of the child did not reveal any abnormality except a grade II/VI systolic
      murmur in left parasternal area. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a
      round pedunculated mass (18 x 30 mm) in left ventricle arising from middle
      of interventricular septum with a pedicle measuring 4 mm at its base. The
      tumour was projecting through aortic valve in systole. Syncope in this
      case was probably due to obstruction of left ventricular outflow tract by
      myxoma leading to a decrease in cardiac output. Complete excision of
      myxoma was done through transmitral approach.

TI  - Real-time three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography during
      percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of mitral periprosthetic paravalvular
      leak.
AB  - We present the case of an 86-year-old female patient with a history of
      mitral valve replacement due to relevant stenosis. After surgery, an
      increasing periprosthetic valvular leak (PVL) became obvious causing
      regurgitation and an increasing haemolysis. Conventional two-dimensional
      transoesophageal echocardiography (2D TEE) showed a defect of 15 mm length
      located from the lateral to the posterior circumference subdivided by two
      surgical sutures into three parts. The patient refused additional surgical
      therapy. Hence, we suggested a percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of the
      leakage with a 12 x 5 mm Amplatzer((R)) Vascular Plug III device (AVP)
      (AGA Medical Corporation, Plymouth, MA, USA). The placement of the device
      was supported indispensably by real-time three-dimensional TEE. The device
      occluded the leakage nearly completely and downgraded the regurgitation
      from moderate to neglectable. Also haemolytic parameters improved
      significantly. V-wave decreased promptly from 70 to 35 mmHg after placing
      AVP. Percutaneous closure of PVL by AVP, a self-expandable nitinol device
      approved for peripheral vessel occlusion, is described in limited cases
      with more or less successful results. It is graded as a technically
      demanding procedure reserved to poor surgical candidates. The main
      challenge is finding and intubating the leakage and the correct placement
      of the device. Three-dimensional TEE seems to be superior to conventional
      2D TEE as it allows an easier guidance of the device into the defect.
      Hence, it is strongly recommended for this intracardiac intervention.

TI  - Stability of HER2-positive status in breast carcinoma: a comparison
      between primary and paired metastatic tumors with regard to the possible
      impact of intervening trastuzumab treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, the stability of human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)-positive primary breast carcinomas during disease
      progression and the role of intervening trastuzumab treatment in the loss
      of HER2-positive status in paired metastases remain under-investigated.
      Materials and methods: Sixty-six patients with HER2-positive primary
      carcinoma and paired metastasis were evaluated. We examined the overall
      agreement of the HER2 status and compared the status agreement between 38
      trastuzumab-treated patients and 28 trastuzumab-naive control patients.
      The impact of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, metastatic site
      (locoregional or distant), and time to relapse (&gt;/=5 or &lt;5 years) on the
      HER2 status change was assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-six (84.9%) patients had
      HER2 status agreement between paired tumors; 10 patients had
      HER2-positive-to-negative conversion. The agreement rate in the
      trastuzumab-treated group and in the control group was comparable (86.8%
      versus 82.1%) (P = 0.858). Chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, metastatic
      site, and time to relapse did not significantly affect HER2 stability in
      either group. In the discordant tumor pairs, variations in testing methods
      and borderline scores were common. CONCLUSIONS: HER2-positive status
      remained unchanged in most paired metastases. Loss of HER2-positive status
      did not seem to be affected by trastuzumab treatment. Differences in
      testing and interpretation may account for the discordance in some cases.

TI  - A follow-up study of early interceptive treatment of primary anterior
      crossbites.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcome of early
      interceptive treatment of primary anterior crossbites with posterior
      occlusal acrylic resin blocks in combination with a 2 x 4 appliance, and
      to examine the differences in craniofacial morphology between the stable
      and relapse groups. Lateral cephalograms of 46 subjects (17 males and 29
      females; average mean age 4 years 2 months +/- 5 months) with a primary
      anterior crossbite were obtained before (T0) and immediately after (T1)
      treatment and at a 6 year follow-up (T2). The patients were assigned to
      either a stable (n = 35; 13 males and 22 females) or a relapse (n = 11; 4
      males and 7 females) group according to the amount of overjet when the
      permanent incisors had erupted. The differences in craniofacial morphology
      between the groups were compared using a two-tailed t-test. The results
      revealed that the relapse subjects had a more forward position of the
      mandible relative to the cranial base and maxilla, a longer mandible and
      an increased gonial angle at T0. At T1, both groups had a positive
      overjet, but the treatment changes were different. Between T1 and T2, the
      maxillary length (A'-Ptm') increased less in the relapse group, the angle
      between the posterior border of the mandibular ramus and SN plane (Ram-SN)
      decreased and gonial angle increased and vice versa in the stable group.
      When posterior bite raising and 2 x 4 appliance therapy are used to
      correct primary anterior crossbites, all patients showed an immediate
      positive treatment response, whereas approximately one-quarter of subjects
      relapsed into a reverse overjet when the permanent incisors had erupted,
      mainly because of a more severe Class III craniofacial morphology at T1
      and unfavourable growth during T1-T2.

TI  - A comparative in vitro study of frictional resistance between lingual
      brackets and stainless steel archwires.
AB  - Friction between archwires and labial brackets has received considerable
      attention; however, information on the frictional behaviour of
      commercially available lingual brackets is limited. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the frictional resistance resulting from a combination
      of lingual orthodontic brackets (7th Generation, STb, Magic, and
      In-Ovation L) and stainless steel archwires at 0, 5, and 10 degrees of
      second-order angulations. Each bracket type (n = 30) was tested with three
      different sizes of archwires. Static and kinetic frictional forces were
      evaluated with a universal testing machine (Zwick/Roell). Statistical
      analysis of the data was performed with non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and
      Dunn's multiple comparison tests. All tested brackets showed higher
      frictional forces as the wire size and second-order angulation increased.
      The lowest friction was found with In-Ovation L brackets and 0.016 inch
      archwires at 0 degrees angulation, and the greatest friction with a
      combination of STb brackets and 0.017 x 0.025 inch archwires at 10 degrees
      angulation. For all combinations, Magic and In-Ovation L brackets showed
      lower frictional resistance when compared with 7th Generation and STb
      brackets. The slot width (occluso-gingival dimension) of the brackets,
      measured using the optics of a microhardness machine, showed that all
      brackets were oversized and that Magic brackets had the largest slot
      width. Surface roughness of the brackets investigated using atomic force
      microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, demonstrated that the 7th
      Generation brackets had the greatest surface roughness.

TI  - Microanatomical Correlates of Cognitive Ability and Decline: Normal
      Ageing, MCI, and Alzheimer's Disease.
AB  - Few microanatomical measures have been reliably correlated with cognitive
      measures in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly in the early
      stages of degeneration, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However,
      cortical minicolumn organization has been shown to correlate with
      cognitive ability in aging monkeys, and the present study extends this
      finding to humans. We have previously reported that minicolumn spacing of
      cells in human association cortex is selectively reduced in normal aging
      (minicolumn thinning). The present study found that such measures detected
      early disease changes in MCI as well as further minicolumn thinning and
      disruption in AD. Plaques, tangles, and minicolumns were quantified,
      postmortem, for 20 controls, 10 MCI, and 20 AD subjects. Minicolumn
      changes were correlated with premortem cognitive scores (mini-mental state
      examination and verbal fluency). Two regions were studied from each brain:
      association cortex in the planum temporale (BA22) and primary auditory
      cortex (BA41). The relationship between minicolumns and cognitive function
      was strongest in association cortex, whereas in primary auditory cortex,
      it appeared to be an epiphenomenon of overall brain atrophy.
      Microanatomical changes reflecting selective regional vulnerability to AD
      pathology and differential involvement in the cognitive deficit of AD are
      therefore detectable in the early stage of MCI.

TI  - Correction of systematic set-up error in breast and head and neck
      irradiation through a no-action level (NAL) protocol.
PG  - 34-42
AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify systematic and random patient set-up errors in breast
      and head and neck conventional irradiation and to evaluate a no-action
      level (NAL) protocol for systematic set-up error off-line correction in
      head and neck cancer and breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Verification electronic portal images of orthogonal set-up fields were
      obtained daily for the initial four consecutive fractions for 20 patients
      treated for breast cancer and for 20 head and neck cancer patients. The
      calculated systematic error was used to shift the isocentre accordingly on
      the fifth treatment day. From then until the end of the treatment course,
      pair orthogonal portal images of set-up fields were obtained weekly. To
      assess the impact of the protocol, pre- and post-correction systematic
      errors were compared and PTV margins were estimated before and after
      correction using published margin recipes. RESULTS: Population systematic
      set-up error decreased in the breast cancer patient group after the
      implementation of NAL protocol from 4.0 to 1.7 mm on the x-axis, from 4.7
      to 2.1 mm on the y-axis and from 2.8 to 0.9 mm on the z axis. The
      percentage of patients with individual systematic set-up error reduction
      was 80%, 90% and 80% on the x-, y and z-axes respectively. Population
      systematic set-up error decreased also in the head and neck cancer patient
      group from 2.3 to 1.1 mm on the x-axis, from 1.6 to 1.4 mm on the y-axis
      and from 1.7 to 0.7 mm on the z-axis. The percentage of patients with
      individual systematic set-up error reduction was 70%, 65% and 85% on the
      x-, y- and z-axes respectively. Margin reduction achievable with NAL
      protocol implementation on the x-, y- and z-axes was 6.3, 7.2 and 4.8 mm
      for breast cancer patients and 3.3, 0.6 and 2.8 mm for head and neck
      cancer patients. CONCLUSION: NAL off-line protocol is useful for
      systematic set-up error correction and PTV margin reduction in
      conventional breast and head and neck irradiation.

TI  - Molecular determinant-based typing of KIR alleles and KIR ligands.
PG  - 274-81
AB  - Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) regulate NK cell
      function. KIRs and their HLA ligands are highly polymorphic in nature with
      substantial allelic polymorphism. At present, there is a lack of an
      expedient method for KIR and HLA allele typing with relevant functional
      information. Here, we developed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      assay to type various allele groups of KIR2DL1 with distinct functional
      properties based on polymorphism at position 245. We also established a
      SNP assay to type different KIR ligands based on polymorphism at position
      77 in HLA-C and position 83 in HLA-B and -A. Our SNP assays for KIR and
      KIR ligand typing are much cheaper and faster than existing
      high-resolution typing. Importantly, our high-throughput methods provide
      readouts that are informative in predicting NK cell activity in health,
      disease, and transplantation.

TI  - Growth hormone can improve insulin resistance and differentiation in
      pancreas of senescence accelerated prone male mice (SAMP8).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of
      aging on several parameters related to glucose metabolism, proliferation
      and differentiation in the pancreas and how GH administration to old SAMP8
      mice could affect these parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pancreas
      samples were obtained from two types of male mice models:
      senescence-accelerated prone (SAMP8) and senescence-accelerated-resistant
      (SAMR1) mice SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice and the influence of exogenous
      administration of GH (2mgs.c./kg/day) on SAMP8 mice. RNA was isolated from
      pancreas samples of male mice using the kit RNeasy total RNA kit Ref.
      50974104 (Qiagen). Insulin was measured in plasma by RIA kit and glucose
      was measured in plasma by an assay kit. RESULTS: Aging decreases the
      expression of differentiation in the pancreas of Pdx-1, FoxO 1 and FoxO 3A
      but not of Sirt 1 or of the expression of the proliferative genes PCNA and
      Sei1. The expression of glucagon and GLUT2 were increased with aging and
      no differences were observed in somatostatin and insulin expressions.
      Insulin levels in plasma were increased with aging in SAMP8 mice. IGF-1
      expression was reduced with aging. The treatment with GH was able to
      increase the expression of Sirt 1, Pdx-1, FoxO 3A and IGF-1. On the other
      hand, the treatment decreased the expression of glucagon, GLUT2,
      somatostatin and insulin, furthermore GH was able to decrease the plasma
      levels of insulin in old male SAMP8 mice (p&lt;0.0004). CONCLUSION: The
      present study has shown that aging is associated with significant
      alterations in the relative expression of pancreatic genes involved in
      insulin secretion as well as in the differentiation and in the intra islet
      glucose metabolism. According to our results, GH administration to old
      SAMP8 mice was able to improve the pancreatic function of the old SAMP8
      mice and to decrease insulin and glucagon expressions in the pancreas
      improving instead insulin levels and glucose metabolism.

TI  - Extraoral Plasmablastic Lymphoma With Intravascular Component and MYC
      Translocation.
AB  - Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an uncommon, clinically aggressive,
      Epstein-Barr virus-driven B-cell lymphoma that was initially described in
      tumors of relatively young human immunodeficiency virus-positive men.
      Subsequent to initial reports, the clinical and pathological spectrum of
      this disease has been expanded such that, now, PBL is recognized to be a
      heterogeneous disease entity. Plasmablastic lymphoma has been seen in
      clinical settings outside those initially reported and has been shown to
      demonstrate a variety of morphologic patterns. We describe a case of
      extraoral PBL in an human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with a
      computed tomography-identified heterogeneously enhancing mass in the
      stomach. Histologically, a prominent intravascular component was
      identified. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis for MYC/IGH
      (immunoglobulin heavy chain) rearrangement t(8;14) identified fusion
      signals, confirming the presence of MYC rearrangement. The presence of a
      prominent intravascular in our case is unique. To our knowledge, these
      findings have not been observed in the previous reports of PBL. The
      observation of this vascular component supports the heterogeneity of PBL
      and may be an indicator of tumor aggressiveness. We were able to
      demonstrate the MYC/IGH rearrangement in our case of PBL. The interplay
      between Epstein-Barr virus and this MYC rearrangement may be similar to
      what is observed in Burkitt lymphoma, another clinically aggressive
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

TI  - Oncocytoma of the kidney with prominent intracytoplasmic lumina.
AB  - Oncocytoma is a histologically distinctive neoplasm of the kidney, with a
      well-recognized cytoarchitectural appearance. On occasion, however, renal
      oncocytomas are known to exhibit unusual morphologic features that may
      pose diagnostic difficulties. We present the clinical and pathologic
      details of an oncocytoma of the kidney with an unusual histologic
      appearance imparted by the presence of large numbers of prominent
      intracytoplasmic lumens. Morphologically, the neoplasm was composed of
      uniform polygonal cells with copious amounts of granular, eosinophilic
      cytoplasm, round nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, exhibiting an organoid
      pattern of growth. Intracytoplasmic lumina of varying size were present
      throughout the tumor. There were no mitotic figures or areas of necrosis
      present. The diagnosis of oncocytoma was supported by immunohistochemical
      and ultrastructural studies. By electron microscopy, the intracytoplasmic
      lumens appeared as membrane bound spaces with associated microvilli. The
      presence of intracytoplasmic lumina in a significant proportion of cells
      is an uncommon feature of renal oncocytoma which can generate problems in
      diagnosis. Awareness of this phenomenon should allow for improved
      recognition of oncocytomas exhibiting this type of unusual morphology.

TI  - Odontogenic tumors: A 5-year retrospective study in a Brazilian population
      and analysis of 3406 cases reported in the literature.
AB  - OBJECTIVE.: The objective of this study was to analyze the frequency and
      distribution of odontogenic tumors in Fortaleza, Brazil, and compare the
      findings with those reported in the literature. STUDY DESIGN.: A total of
      6231 oral lesions retrieved from 5 anatomic pathology services in
      Fortaleza, Brazil, over a 5-year period, were reviewed. In addition, the
      literature was searched for studies on odontogenic tumors (OTs) according
      to the 2005 WHO classification. RESULTS.: Within the total 6231 oral
      lesions, 185 (2.97%) were OTs, all benign. OTs presented a female
      predilection, with a male:female ratio of 0.62:1.00. These neoplasms
      occurred over a wide range of ages (1 to 78 years), with a mean of 30.5
      years. Ameloblastomas, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, and odontomas were
      the most frequent OT types. CONCLUSIONS.: OTs are rare neoplasms and
      appear to show geographic variations. In Fortaleza, Brazil, they are more
      common in female patients, with ameloblastoma followed by keratocystic
      odontogenic tumors as the most frequent OTs.

TI  - A polymorphism linked to elevated levels of interferon-gamma is associated
      with an increased risk of cytomegalovirus disease among Caucasian lung
      transplant recipients at a single center.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with active
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after lung transplantation have not been
      identified. METHODS: SNPs associated with varying levels of interferon
      (IFN)-gamma (+874T/A), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (-308G/A),
      interleukin-10 (-1082G/A, -819C/T, -592C/A) and interleukin-6 (-174G/C)
      were characterized for 170 Caucasian lung transplant recipients who
      received alemtuzumab induction and valganciclovir prophylaxis against CMV.
      RESULTS: Patients were followed for a median of 34 months post-transplant,
      and 66% (113 of 170), 24% (40 of 170) and 10% (17 of 170) had no CMV
      infection, CMV viremia and CMV disease, respectively. Median times to CMV
      viremia and disease were 7 and 10 months, respectively. For each gene,
      there was no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
      Independent risk factors for the development of CMV disease were IFN-gamma
      +874 T/T genotype (associated with high levels of IFN-gamma production),
      CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative (D(+)/R(-)) serostatus and acute
      cellular rejection requiring augmented immunosuppression (p = 0.001, 0.003
      and 0.049, respectively). The association between IFN-gamma +874 T/T
      genotype and CMV disease was most striking among R(+) patients (p = 0.02).
      D(+)/R(-) serostatus was also a significant risk factor for CMV viremia (p
      = 0.0005). IFN-gamma +874 T/T genotype was associated with significantly
      lower peak CMV viral loads (p = 0.03). There were no associations between
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-10 or interleukin-6 SNPs and CMV
      infections. CONCLUSION: A genetic predisposition to elevated IFN-gamma
      levels may play a dual role in controlling active CMV infection among lung
      transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab induction and valganciclovir
      prophylaxis, limiting the extent of viral replication in serum but
      increasing the risk of CMV disease.

TI  - Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field exposure does not modulate
      toll-like receptor signaling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - The effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) on
      human health remain unclear. It has been reported that ELF-EMF may
      modulate the innate immune response to microorganisms in animal models and
      mammalian cell-lines. With the recently gained insight in innate immune
      signaling and the discovery of pattern recognition, we aim to study
      whether ELF-EMF modulates innate inflammatory signaling pathways. We used
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated from blood from
      healthy volunteers, which we stimulated with specific TLR2 and TLR4
      ligands, and with several microorganisms. The cells were subsequently
      exposed in B(dc)=3muT to a highly controlled and standardized ELF-EMF
      signal (20-5000Hz, B(ac)=5muT, 30min) and cytokine production was measured
      at different time points after stimulation. No significant difference in
      immune response, as reflected by IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-8 and IL-10
      production, could be detected after stimulation with LPS (TLR4 ligand),
      Pam3Cys (TLR2 ligand) or a panel of heat killed microorganisms:
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium, Candida albicans,
      Aspergillus fumigatus and Staphylococcus aureus (multiple TLR ligands). We
      therefore conclude that under our experimental conditions, ELF-EMF does
      not modulate the innate immune response of human primary cells after TLR
      stimulation in vitro.

TI  - [C(3)(OH)(2)mim][BF(4)]-Au/Pt biosensor for glutamate sensing in vivo
      integrated with on-line microdialysis system.
PG  - 3227-32
AB  - A new type of hydroxyl functionalized room temperature ionic liquid
      (RTIL), [C(3)(OH)(2)mim][BF(4)], was synthesized herein and a novel
      H(2)O(2) biosensor is fabricated with [C(3)(OH)(2)mim][BF(4)] as the
      substrate and electrodepositing bimetallic Au/Pt nanoparticles (NPs) onto
      the [C(3)(OH)(2)mim][BF(4)] film. The functionalization of RTIL with
      hydroxyl groups provided an appropriate environment for the preparation of
      more uniform and smaller Au/Pt NPs with the diameter of 2.5nm+/-0.2nm.
      Immobilized with glutamate oxidase (GlutaOx), the resulting
      GlutaOx-[C(3)(OH)(2)mim][BF(4)]-Au/Pt-Nafion biosensor displayed excellent
      electrocatalytic response to glutamate at a potential of -200mV. An
      effective on-line microdialysis system, which was powered by a
      microdialysis pump, was set up and used for the detection of glutamate
      successively in the striatum of rats. The glutamate biosensor in on-line
      microdialysis system showed good linear range from 0.5muM to 20.0muM with
      the detection limit of 0.17muM (S/N=3). The basal level of glutamate in
      the striatum of anaesthetic rats was calculated to be 3.01+/-0.67muM
      (n=3). The application of the GlutaOx-[C(3)(OH)(2)mim][BF(4)]-Au/Pt-Nafion
      electrode is further demonstrated for in vivo sensing of the variation of
      glutamate level in the striatum when rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.)
      injection of 100mM KCl and brain electrical stimulation of the subthalamic
      nucleus area (STN). Both of the two kinds of stimulation resulted in an
      increase in the extracellular concentration of glutamate. This method has
      proved to be sensitive and reproducible, which enables its promising
      application in physiology and pathology.

TI  - The EFFect of hIgh-dose ClopIdogrel treatmENT in patients with clopidogrel
      resistance (The EFFICIENT Trial).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of high-dose
      clopidogrel continuation treatment on the development of MACCE after
      elective PCI in patients with clopidogrel resistance. METHODS: The study
      group consisted of 192 patients. Of these, 98 participants without
      resistance served as the control group (Group 1) and received 75mg/day
      clopidogrel for 1month. Ninety-four patients with resistance were randomly
      divided into two groups: 47 patients in the standard-dose group (Group 2)
      received 75mg/day continuation therapy, whereas 47 patients in the
      high-dose group (Group 3) received 150mg/day continuation therapy for
      1month. Clopidogrel resistance was evaluated with the VerifyNow P2Y12
      test. Patients with a platelet inhibition value lower than 40% were
      classified as resistant. RESULTS: During the 6-month follow-up for MACCE,
      the event-rate in Group 2 was significantly higher than both Groups 1 and
      3 (Group 1 vs Group 2; p=0.019, Group 1 vs Group 3; p=0.82, Group 2 vs
      Group 3; p=0.045). Total bleeding rate in all groups were similar (Group 1
      vs Group 2; p=0.54, Group 1 vs Group 3; p=0.27, Group 2 vs Group 3;
      p=0.16). The rate of NACE was similar in all groups (Group 1 vs Group 2;
      p=0.08, Group 1 vs Group 3; p=0.50, Group 2 vs Group 3; p=0.39).
      CONCLUSION: In patients who underwent elective PCI and had clopidogrel
      resistance, high-dose clopidogrel continuation therapy was more efficient
      in preventing MACCE than the standard dose. High-dose continuation therapy
      did not increase the risk of bleeding complication (The EFFICIENT Trial;
      ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01032668).

TI  - Risk of atrial fibrillation according to the initial presentation of a
      preexcitation syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is frequent in
      Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). Atrial fibrillation (AF) is rare.
      The purpose of the study was to determine the factors of spontaneous AF in
      WPW according to the initial presentation. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed among 709 patients with a
      preexcitation syndrome. First event was AF in 44 patients. Remaining
      patients were studied for AVRT (314), syncope (94), adverse presentation
      without AF (9) or systematically (248 asymptomatic patients). Patients
      with AF were older than other patients (44+/-16years vs 34.5+/-17)
      (0.0003); maximal rate conducted over accessory pathway (AP) was higher in
      patients with AF than in other patients except in adverse presentation
      (0.0002); AVRT was induced more frequently in patients with AF than in
      asymptomatic patients (57% vs 14.5%) but less than in patients with AVRT
      (89%). AF was induced more frequently in patients with AF than in other
      patients except in adverse presentation (&lt;0.0001). During follow-up AF
      occurred more frequently in patients with AF (5; 11%) than in patients
      with AVRT (7; 2%), with syncope (1%) and asymptomatic patients (4; 1.6%).
      Older age predicted recurrence (54+/-16 vs 40+/-17). CONCLUSIONS: AF was
      the first event in only 6% of patients with WPW and was a rare event in
      other patients. They are older but 10% are less than 18years and have a
      more rapid conduction over AP than other patients.

TI  - Identification of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant odors in
      schizophrenia.
AB  - Recent work on odor hedonics in schizophrenia has indicated that patients
      display abnormalities in hedonic judgments of odors in comparison to
      healthy comparison participants. In the current study, identification
      accuracy for pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant odors in individuals with
      schizophrenia and healthy controls was examined. Thirty-three
      schizophrenia patients (63% male) and thirty-one healthy volunteers (65%
      male) were recruited. The groups were well matched on age, sex, and
      smoking status. Participants were administered the University of
      Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, which was subsequently divided
      into 16 pleasant, 15 neutral, and 9 unpleasant items. Analysis of
      identification z-scores for pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant odors
      revealed a significant diagnosis by valence interaction. Post-hoc analysis
      revealed that schizophrenia participants made more identification errors
      on pleasant and neutral odors compared to healthy controls, with no
      differences observed for unpleasant odors. No effect was seen for sex. The
      findings from the current investigation suggest that odor identification
      accuracy in patients is influenced by odor valence. This pattern of
      results parallels a growing body of literature indicating that patients
      display aberrant pleasantness ratings for pleasant odors and highlights
      the need for additional research on the influence of odor valence on
      olfactory identification performance in individuals with schizophrenia.

TI  - Biochemical response of amphipods (Gammarid: Paramorea) in a sediment
      laboratory exposure from Ushuaia Bay, Beagle Channel.
AB  - A coastal system (Ushuaia Bay, Argentina) impacted by anthropogenic
      activities was studied by the response of local amphipods (Parmorea sp.,
      Gammaridae) to the exposure of coastal sediments in a laboratory assay.
      Four coastal areas with different loadings of contaminants and one
      considered as reference were studied. Organic matter, carbohydrates,
      proteins and heavy metals were measured in sediment samples. Organisms
      were exposed to sediments for seven days and catalase (CAT), glutathione
      S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and lipid peroxidation
      (LPO) were measured afterward. Amphipods exhibited an activation of GST
      and inhibition of AChE in most impacted areas. Principal Component
      Analysis (PCA) was conducted in order to associate the biological
      responses with sediment metal concentration and its eutrophicated status.
      Levels of Cd and Cr were associated with the inhibition of AChE and with
      the enhancement of GST. CAT and LPO were enhanced in most areas, but no
      link was found with the contaminants studied by PCA, suggesting that other
      parameters present in sediments not included in the PCA affect the
      amphipods. The most impacted area corresponds to Nautical Club station,
      with a highly eutrophicated status and high content of metals, where
      amphipods after the exposure were affected in a biochemical level.

TI  - Identification of ADAMTS7 as a novel locus for coronary atherosclerosis
      and association of ABO with myocardial infarction in the presence of
      coronary atherosclerosis: two genome-wide association studies.
PG  - 383-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested whether genetic factors distinctly contribute to
      either development of coronary atherosclerosis or, specifically, to
      myocardial infarction in existing coronary atherosclerosis. METHODS: We
      did two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with coronary angiographic
      phenotyping in participants of European ancestry. To identify loci that
      predispose to angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), we compared
      individuals who had this disorder (n=12,393) with those who did not
      (controls, n=7383). To identify loci that predispose to myocardial
      infarction, we compared patients who had angiographic CAD and myocardial
      infarction (n=5783) with those who had angiographic CAD but no myocardial
      infarction (n=3644). FINDINGS: In the comparison of patients with
      angiographic CAD versus controls, we identified a novel locus, ADAMTS7
      (p=4.98x10(-13)). In the comparison of patients with angiographic CAD who
      had myocardial infarction versus those with angiographic CAD but no
      myocardial infarction, we identified a novel association at the ABO locus
      (p=7.62x10(-9)). The ABO association was attributable to the
      glycotransferase-deficient enzyme that encodes the ABO blood group O
      phenotype previously proposed to protect against myocardial infarction.
      INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that specific genetic
      predispositions promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis
      whereas others lead to myocardial infarction in the presence of coronary
      atherosclerosis. The relation to specific CAD phenotypes might modify how
      novel loci are applied in personalised risk assessment and used in the
      development of novel therapies for CAD. FUNDING: The PennCath and MedStar
      studies were supported by the Cardiovascular Institute of the University
      of Pennsylvania, by the MedStar Health Research Institute at Washington
      Hospital Center and by a research grant from GlaxoSmithKline. The funding
      and support for the other cohorts contributing to the paper are described
      in the webappendix.

TI  - Mammalian target of rapamycin regulates expression of beta-catenin in
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
AB  - Although evidence has shown that both the mammalian target of rapamycin
      and beta-catenin are involved in hepatocellular carcinoma, little is known
      about their relationship in pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. To
      investigate the expression of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin
      and beta-catenin and their prognostic impacts, as well as their
      relationship in hepatocellular carcinoma, we analyzed 63 human
      hepatocellular carcinoma samples by immunohistochemistry. Phosphorylated
      mammalian target of rapamycin cytoplasmic and beta-catenin
      cytoplasmic/nuclear-positive immunoreactivities were observed in 63.5%
      (40/63) and 55.6% (35/63) of the hepatocellular carcinoma specimens,
      respectively. Significant associations were found between cytoplasmic
      beta-catenin and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin expression
      and tumor size (both P &lt; .01) and metastasis (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .05,
      respectively). In addition, beta-catenin expression in the cytoplasm was
      closely associated with the expression of phosphorylated mammalian target
      of rapamycin. To further explore the relationship between mammalian target
      of rapamycin and beta-catenin, hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and Hep3B
      cells were treated with beta-catenin siRNA and mammalian target of
      rapamycin inhibitor, rapamycin; and the expression of phosphorylated
      mammalian target of rapamycin and beta-catenin in cells was then measured
      by Western blot. The activity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was
      also assessed by luciferase reporter assay. The cell viability and
      proliferation were evaluated by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay
      and [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assay. The results showed that the
      level of beta-catenin protein expression was markedly decreased by
      rapamycin in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. The reduction of beta-catenin and
      mammalian target of rapamycin resulted in inhibition of cell viability
      proliferation, but the combination of reduction of beta-catenin and
      mammalian target of rapamycin did not show a synergistic effect on the
      inhibition of cell viability and proliferation in HepG2 and Hep3B cells.
      In conclusion, the present study showed that, for the first time,
      mammalian target of rapamycin regulated the expression level of
      beta-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma. Both mammalian target of
      rapamycin and beta-catenin play important roles in the growth, metastasis,
      and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Central nervous system marginal zone B-cell lymphoma associated with
      Chlamydophila psittaci infection.
AB  - Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas are linked to bacterial
      infections that vary according to the anatomical site. The occurrence of
      these lymphomas in the central nervous system is a very rare event, and
      the identification of specific bacteria in this setting has not been
      previously addressed. Herein, we report for the first time a case of
      primary central nervous system marginal zone B-cell lymphoma involving the
      choroid plexus associated with Chlamydophila psittaci infection. No
      concomitant ocular involvement was detected. C psittaci was identified
      with 3 independent methods, and through immunohistochemistry, it was
      visualized in the cytoplasm of monocytes/macrophages present within
      lymphomatous tissues. This observation points toward the opportunity to
      investigate the prevalence of C psittaci infection in central nervous
      system lymphomas, particularly in those with low-grade histologic
      features.

      differentiated-type gastric carcinoma with submucosal invasion.
AB  - Dysadherin is a cancer-associated cell membrane glycoprotein that
      down-regulates E-cadherin and plays important roles in tumor progression
      and metastasis. Differentiated-type gastric carcinoma can be classified
      into 2 histologic subtypes according to the presence of poorly
      differentiated components: a mixed type (differentiated carcinoma with
      poorly differentiated components) and a pure type (purely
      differentiated-type adenocarcinoma). We studied the clinicopathologic
      features of 318 cases of differentiated-type gastric carcinoma with
      submucosal invasion and evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of
      dysadherin and E-cadherin. We also evaluated 46 cases of metastatic lymph
      nodes. Tumors with combined dysadherin-positive (&gt;/=50%) expression and
      E-cadherin-negative (&lt;50%) expression had significantly higher proportions
      of the moderately differentiated type, deeper submucosal invasion,
      positivity of lymphatic permeation, and positivity of lymph node
      metastasis than tumors with other combinations of dysadherin and
      E-cadherin expression (P = .0009, P = .0015, P = .0273, and P = .0187,
      respectively). Moreover, the frequency of dysadherin-positive (&gt;/=50%)
      expression was higher in the mixed type (60.3%) than in the pure type
      (12.4%) (P &lt; .0001), whereas the frequency of E-cadherin-negative (&lt;50%)
      expression was higher in the mixed type (84.5%) than in the pure type
      (50.5%) (P &lt; .0001). The frequency of dysadherin expression in the
      metastatic lymph nodes (80.4%) was significantly higher than that in the
      primary tumors (45.7%) (P = .001). Dysadherin-positive (&gt;/=50%) expression
      and E-cadherin-negative (&lt;50%) expression may be correlated with the mixed
      type. Combined dysadherin-positive (&gt;/=50%) expression and
      E-cadherin-negative (&lt;50%) expression may be valuable information for
      predicting aggressive tumor behavior.

TI  - Salvage radical prostatectomy following primary high intensity focused
      ultrasound for treatment of prostate cancer.
PG  - 862-8
AB  - PURPOSE: High intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of primary
      prostate cancer is increasing in a subset of men seeking definitive
      treatment with reduced morbidity. We review outcomes in men undergoing
      salvage radical prostatectomy after failed whole gland high intensity
      focused ultrasound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected
      for men presenting with an increasing prostate specific antigen and biopsy
      proven prostate cancer after high intensity focused ultrasound from 2007
      to 2010 who underwent salvage open radical prostatectomy with a 22-month
      median followup, including prostate specific antigen, prostate volume,
      pathology results, continence and erectile function. RESULTS: Data for 15
      men were available, including median age 64 years (IQR 55-69), Gleason
      score before high intensity focused ultrasound of 6 (8), Gleason score 7
      (7), median cores positive 39% (IQR 17%-63%) and median prostate specific
      antigen 7 ng/ml (IQR 5-8). Whole gland high intensity focused ultrasound
      achieved median nadir prostate specific antigen 1.1 ng/ml (IQR 0.5-3.1).
      Biopsy after high intensity focused ultrasound demonstrated Gleason score
      6 (in 3 patients), 7 (9) and 8/9 (3), and 42% (IQR 25%-50%) cores positive
      and a median time from high intensity focused ultrasound to radical
      prostatectomy of 22 months (IQR 7-26). Perioperative morbidity was limited
      to 1 transfusion in a patient with a rectal injury. Pathologically
      extensive periprostatic fibrosis was found with persistent prostate
      cancer, as pT3 disease (in 9 of 14), Gleason scores 6 (2), 7 (9) and 8 of
      9 (4), with focally positive margins in 3 of 11 (pT3a). Postoperative
      prostate specific antigen was unrecordable in 14 of 15 patients with
      further treatment in 2. Postoperative continence (more than 12 months of
      followup) yielded no pad use in 6 of 10 men with universally poor erectile
      function. CONCLUSIONS: Radical prostatectomy as salvage is feasible for
      men in whom high intensity focused ultrasound failed, but with a higher
      morbidity than for primary surgery. Pathology results are alarming given
      the number of cases with extraprostatic extension yet early followup data
      suggest acceptable oncologic control. These results should be factored in
      when counseling men who wish to undergo primary high intensity focused
      ultrasound.

TI  - Subclinical Atherosclerosis in Latino Youth: Progression of Carotid
      Intima-Media Thickness and Its Relationship to Cardiometabolic Risk
      Factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) change
      over 2 years in overweight Latino adolescents and examine its relationship
      to cardiometabolic risk. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-two healthy overweight male
      and female Latino adolescents (mean age, 14.5 +/- 1.7 years; mean body
      mass index, 31.5 +/- 6.9 kg/m(2)) were evaluated at baseline and 2 years
      later for CIMT by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound, the metabolic
      syndrome and its features, body composition by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging, glucose/insulin measures by
      fasting blood, and oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests. RESULTS:
      Baseline CIMT did not differ from 2-year follow-up; however, 38
      participants increased CIMT (0.017 +/- 0.003 mm; +2.8%) and 34 decreased
      or remained the same (-0.019 +/- 0.002 mm; -3.1%). ANCOVA analyses showed
      that participants with CIMT progression had higher baseline low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and total cholesterol (91.3 +/- 3.4 and
      150.3+/-3.9 mg/dL) compared with those with CIMT non-progression (78.1 +/-
      3.6 and 135.6 +/- 4.2 mg/dL, P &lt; .05), independent of sex, baseline CIMT,
      age, and height. In multivariate regression, LDL-cholesterol was the sole
      predictor of CIMT progression, but the effect was small (odds of CIMT
      progression increased by 3% for each 1 mg/dL higher baseline
      LDL-cholesterol; 95% confidence interval, 1.004 to 1.006, P = .03).
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a high variability in the magnitude of
      CIMT change in growing overweight Latino youth and support the use of
      LDL-cholesterol to assess subclinical atherosclerosis risk in this
      population.

TI  - Immunocytochemical Detection of Rhodococcus equi in Tracheal Washes of
      Foals.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop an immunocytochemical
      procedure for the early detection and demonstration of Rhodococcus equi in
      smears of tracheal aspirates taken from live foals in field conditions.
      Tracheal wash samples were collected from thoroughbred foals, aged 1-5
      months and located in studs around Bursa and Istanbul, Turkey. Some foals
      were suspected of having R. equi infection on the basis of clinical
      examination (n=56) and others were unaffected control animals (n=54).
      Serum samples were also collected from each foal for testing for the
      presence of R. equi-specific antibody by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA). Thirty-six of the control foals (66.7%) and 37 of the affected
      foals (66.1%) were seropositive for R. equi. Immunocytochemical labelling
      was detected in the smears from 73.2% of the affected foals and 70.4% of
      the control foals. For both ELISA and immunocytochemistry (ICC), there was
      no significant difference between the affected and control foals (P&gt;0.05)
      and there was no significant difference between the two test modalities
      (P&gt;0.05). ICC may therefore have similar diagnostic utility when compared
      with ELISA. There is no clear relationship between clinical signs and
      ELISA or ICC positivity.

TI  - Comparative RNAi screening reveals host factors involved in enterovirus
      infection of polarized endothelial monolayers.
PG  - 70-82
AB  - Enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B (CVB) and poliovirus (PV), can
      access the CNS through the blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelium to cause
      aseptic meningitis. To identify cellular components required for CVB and
      PV infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells, an in vitro
      BBB model, we performed comparative RNAi screens and identified 117 genes
      that influenced infection. Whereas a large proportion of genes whose
      depletion enhanced infection (17 of 22) were broadly antienteroviral, only
      46 of the 95 genes whose depletion inhibited infection were required by
      both CVB and PV and included components of cell signaling pathways such as
      adenylate cyclases. Downregulation of genes including Rab GTPases, Src
      tyrosine kinases, and tyrosine phosphatases displayed specificity in their
      requirement for either CVB or PV infection. These findings highlight the
      pathways hijacked by enteroviruses for entry and replication in the BBB
      endothelium, a specialized and clinically relevant cell type for these
      viruses.

TI  - Regulation of caspases in the nervous system implications for functions in
      health and disease.
PG  - 265-305
AB  - Caspases, initially identified as a family of proteases regulating cell
      death, have been found to have nonapoptotic functions as well. Some family
      members are critical for mediating programmed cell death in development.
      After development, caspases are downregulated in the nervous system, but
      continue to perform important nonapoptotic functions relevant for
      neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In neurodegenerative diseases, where
      aberrant neuronal death is an outstanding feature, there is an increase in
      caspase activity. The specific caspase death pathways leading to
      dysfunction and death have still not been fully clarified, despite the
      plethora of scientific literature addressing these issues. In this
      chapter, we will present the current knowledge of caspase activation and
      activity pathways, the current tools for examining caspases, and functions
      of caspases in the nervous system in health and in disease. Alzheimer's
      Disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and cerebral
      ischemia, the most common cause of neurologic death, are used to
      illustrate our current understanding of death signaling in
      neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of how caspases
      function in health and disease would provide appropriate specific targets
      for the development of therapeutic interventions for these diseases.

TI  - Complex Assemblies of Factors IX and X Regulate the Initiation,
      Maintenance, and Shutdown of Blood Coagulation.
PG  - 51-103
AB  - Blood hemostasis is accomplished by a complex network of
      (anti-)coagulatory and fibrinolytic processes. These physiological
      processes are implemented by the assembly of multiprotein complexes
      involving both humoral and cellular components. Coagulation factor X, and
      particularly, factor IX, exemplify the dramatic enhancement that is
      obtained by the synergistic interaction of cell surface, inorganic and
      protein cofactors, protease, and substrate. With a focus on
      structure-function relationship, we review the current knowledge of
      activity modulation principles in the coagulation proteases factors IX and
      X and indicate future challenges for hemostasis research. This chapter is
      organized by describing the principles of hierarchical activation of blood
      coagulation proteases, including endogenous and exogenous protease
      activators, cofactor binding, substrate specificities, and protein
      inhibitors. We conclude by outlining pharmaceutical opportunities for
      unmet needs in hemophilia and thrombosis.

TI  - Microautophagy of cytosolic proteins by late endosomes.
PG  - 131-9
AB  - Autophagy delivers cytosolic components to lysosomes for their
      degradation. The delivery of autophagic cargo to late endosomes for
      complete or partial degradation has also been described. In this report we
      present evidence that distinct autophagic mechanisms control cytosolic
      protein delivery to late endosomes and identify a microautophagy-like
      process that delivers soluble cytosolic proteins to the vesicles of late
      endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs). This microautophagy-like process
      has selectivity and is distinct from chaperone-mediated autophagy that
      occurs in lysosomes. Endosomal microautophagy occurs during MVB formation,
      relying on the ESCRT I and III systems for formation of the vesicles in
      which the cytosolic cargo is internalized. Protein cargo selection is
      mediated by the chaperone hsc70 and requires the cationic domain of hsc70
      for electrostatic interactions with the endosomal membrane. Therefore, we
      propose that endosomal microautophagy shares molecular components with
      both the endocytic and autophagic pathways.

TI  - Robo4 maintains vessel integrity and inhibits angiogenesis by interacting
      with UNC5B.
PG  - 33-46
AB  - Robo4 is an endothelial cell-specific member of the Roundabout axon
      guidance receptor family. To identify Robo4 binding partners, we performed
      a protein-protein interaction screen with the Robo4 extracellular domain.
      We find that Robo4 specifically binds to UNC5B, a vascular Netrin
      receptor, revealing unexpected interactions between two endothelial
      guidance receptors. We show that Robo4 maintains vessel integrity by
      activating UNC5B, which inhibits signaling downstream of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies
      against Robo4 and UNC5B increase angiogenesis and disrupt vessel
      integrity. Soluble Robo4 protein inhibits VEGF-induced vessel permeability
      and rescues barrier defects in Robo4(-/-) mice, but not in mice treated
      with anti-UNC5B. Thus, Robo4-UNC5B signaling maintains vascular integrity
      by counteracting VEGF signaling in endothelial cells, identifying a novel
      function of guidance receptor interactions in the vasculature.

TI  - New developments in the molecular pathogenesis of head and neck tumors: a
      review of tumor-specific fusion oncogenes in mucoepidermoid carcinoma,
      adenoid cystic carcinoma, and NUT midline carcinoma.
PG  - 69-77
AB  - Tumor-specific chromosomal rearrangements often produce potent fusion
      oncogenes, which induce tumorigenesis by 2 alternative mechanisms:
      deregulation of the cell cycle resulting in gene overexpression or gene
      fusion resulting in a hybrid, chimeric oncogene. Tumor-specific recurrent
      chromosomal translocations and novel fusion oncogenes in aggressive head
      and neck malignancies have diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic
      implications. Recently, pathognomonic fusion transcripts have been
      identified in various uncommon, aggressive head and neck malignancies,
      including mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC),
      and NUT midline carcinoma (NMC). The t(11;19)(q12;p13) translocation in
      MEC results in fusion of the MECT1 gene at 19p13 and the MAML2 gene at
      11q21. The MECT1-MAML2 fusion transcript, present in more than half of
      MECs, is associated with lower histologic grades and improved survival,
      suggesting both diagnostic and prognostic roles in clinical management.
      The t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) translocation in ACC results in fusion of the
      MYB gene at 6q22-23 and the NFIB gene at 9p23-24. The MYB-NFIB fusion
      transcript, present in at least one third of salivary ACCs, can be
      detected by new reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction screening
      methods, and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. The
      t(15;19)(q14;p13.1) translocation in NMC results in fusion of the NUT gene
      at 15q14 and the BRD4 gene at 19p13.1. This occurs in two thirds of NMC.
      Because NMC lacks characteristic clinicopathologic features and
      established therapeutic options, the BRD4-NUT fusion transcript may
      represent both a diagnostic marker and an optimal target for
      disease-specific drug therapy. Moreover, immunohistochemical advances have
      yielded a promising new monoclonal antibody against the NUT antigen, which
      may improve NMC diagnosis. Next-generation sequencing methods, such as the
      use of massively parallel and paired-end sequencing in the study of cancer
      genomes, will likely disclose novel fusion transcripts in more human
      malignancies. Hopefully, as technological advances unravel the molecular
      pathogenesis of aggressive carcinomas, diagnostic and therapeutic options
      will evolve to improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - Chromosomal abnormalities in renal cell carcinoma variants detected by
      Urovysion fluorescence in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded tissue.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - Urovysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (UVFISH) identifies malignant
      cells in urine by detecting specific urothelial carcinoma-related
      chromosomal abnormalities. Some renal carcinomas (RCCs) share overlapping
      chromosomal aberrations with urothelial carcinoma. Malignant renal cells
      that are shed in urine can potentially cause a positive UVFISH result. We
      evaluated UVFISH in RCCs to determine its potential applicability to the
      diagnosis and grading of RCCs. Paraffin blocks from 39 RCCs (25 clear
      cell, 9 papillary, 2 chromophobe, and 3 sarcomatoid) and 15 controls (5
      renal oncocytomas and 10 urothelial carcinomas) were tested. Of the RCCs,
      15 (40%) were UVFISH-positive (9/25 [40%] clear cell, 3/9 [30%] papillary,
      1/2 [50%] chromophobe, and 2/3 [67%] sarcomatoid carcinoma) and 24 (60%)
      were negative. Of the 15 controls, 8 ( approximately 50%) were
      UVFISH-positive (2/5 [40%] oncocytomas and 6/10 [60%] urothelial
      carcinomas) and 7 ( approximately 50%) were UVFISH-negative. Polysomy of
      chromosome 17 showed a statistically significant correlation with RCC
      subtype, being absent in most of the clear cell RCCs (P = .0096) compared
      with other RCCs. Polysomy of chromosome 7 was more frequent in high-grade
      than low-grade RCC (P = .0197) and more likely in high-grade clear cell
      than low-grade clear cell RCC (P = .0120). In conclusion, we showed that
      RCC has overlapping chromosomal abnormalities with urothelial carcinoma
      and can cause a positive UVFISH result. This has implications for the
      interpretation of Urovysion in patients whose urine contains malignant
      cells but who have negative cystoscopy and a concomitant renal mass. The
      chromosomal abnormalities observed in RCC are not distinct from those in
      urothelial carcinoma; therefore, UVFISH cannot distinguish these tumor
      types, nor can it type or grade RCC.

TI  - Hemoglobin, erythropoietin and systemic inflammation in exacerbations of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 103-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation may represent a possible cause of
      anemia. Previous data support that anemic patients with COPD present high
      erythropoietin (EPO) levels, suggestive of EPO resistance, possibly
      mediated through inflammatory mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to
      determine whether systemic inflammation, which is usually up-regulated
      during exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) is associated with low hemoglobin
      levels expressing erythropoietin resistance. METHODS: Hemoglobin (Hb), EPO
      and serum biomarkers of systemic inflammation [CRP, TNF-alpha, fibrinogen
      and IL-6] were assessed at three time points (admission, resolution and
      stable phases) in a selected cohort of 93 COPD patients. RESULTS:
      Hemoglobin levels were significantly lower on admission compared to
      resolution and stable phases (median 12.1 g/dl [interquartile ranges
      11.2-12.7], vs 13.5 [12.4-14.3] vs 13.4 [12.7-14.08], respectively
      p=0.002), whereas EPO was significantly higher on admission compared to
      resolution and stable phases. A negative association between Hb and IL-6
      and a positive association between EPO and IL-6 were observed only during
      the acute phase of exacerbation. EPO and Hb were negatively associated
      during the acute phase, whereas they were positively associated during
      discharge and stable phase. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study we
      have shown that during admission for ECOPD Hb levels are decreased and EPO
      levels are increased. We have also identified a negative association
      between Hb and EPO. The above association is mainly related to increased
      IL-6 levels, indicating a possible EPO resistance through the mechanism of
      increased systemic inflammatory process.

TI  - Use of standing orders for adult influenza vaccination a national survey
      of primary care physicians.
PG  - 144-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination of adults remains below recommended
      levels. Standing orders programs (SOPs) that allow nonphysician medical
      staff to assess eligibility and administer vaccines without an
      individualized physician's order are a proven method to increase
      vaccination rates. However, recent data on their use are not available.
      PURPOSE: Investigators surveyed primary care physicians nationwide in 2009
      to assess factors related to awareness and use of SOPs. METHODS: Using the
      AMA Master List, a stratified random sample of U.S. family physicians
      (n=820) and general internists (n=820) was selected to receive a mailed
      questionnaire. The inclusion criterion was providing primary care to
      adults in an office-based practice. The primary outcome measure, analyzed
      in 2010, was consistent use of SOPs. RESULTS: The survey response rate was
      67% (1015/1517). Forty-two percent of respondents who immunized adults in
      their practices reported consistent use of SOPs. Those physicians differed
      in several dimensions, including awareness of recommendations and
      regulations regarding SOPs for vaccines, size and type of practice, number
      and level of training of clinical staff, attributes of the staff. The two
      variables in logistic regression models that were associated with the
      highest likelihood of using SOPs were awareness of recommendations to use
      them (OR=3.0; 95% CI=2.2, 4.1) and agreement with their effectiveness
      (OR=2.7, 95% CI=1.9, 3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Fewer than half of physicians
      report using SOPs for influenza vaccination, a number that is not much
      higher than it was about a decade ago. Approaches to increase use of SOPs
      are needed.

TI  - &quot;Clark/dysplastic&quot; nevi with florid fibroplasia associated with
      pseudomelanomatous features.
PG  - 346-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanocytic nevi may exhibit histologic features in common
      with cutaneous melanoma, creating diagnostic difficulties. OBJECTIVE: We
      sought to assess the clinical behavior of melanocytic nevi with
      pseudomelanomatous features in association with dermal fibrosis. METHODS:
      Forty-two melanocytic nevi with pronounced fibrosis and associated
      pseudomelanomatous changes were collected and studied clinically and
      histologically. RESULTS: The fibrosis was centrally located and laminated
      in appearance. It imparted a trizonal appearance: a junctional component
      with prominent single cells and/or irregular nests, underlying fibrosis,
      and a mature dermal component. No recurrence or metastases were evident
      over an average follow-up period of 2 years. LIMITATIONS: The follow-up
      period was short. CONCLUSIONS: The central location and laminated
      appearance of the fibrosis suggest that this may represent the extreme end
      of a spectrum of fibroplastic changes in &quot;Clark/dysplastic&quot; nevi. Adjacent
      features of &quot;Clark/dysplastic&quot; nevi and limitation of pseudomelanomatous
      features to the perifibrotic focus are important in accurately identifying
      these lesions. Although melanocytic nevi with exaggerated fibroplasia may
      show foci with melanoma-like features, they do not appear to exhibit
      aggressive clinical behavior.

TI  - D2-40 lymphatic marker for detecting lymphatic invasion in thin to
      intermediate thickness melanomas: association with sentinel lymph node
      status and prognostic value-a retrospective case study.
PG  - 336-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is the greatest prognostic
      factor of morbidity in melanoma. D2-40 antibody specifically marks
      lymphatic endothelium and has been used for identifying lymphatic invasion
      (LI) in multiple cancers. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the
      relationship between melanoma lymphatic invasion (as detected using D2-40
      on primary melanoma biopsies/excisions) and the presence or absence of
      melanoma in subsequent SLN biopsy. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated
      LI using D2-40 on primary biopsies/excisions from patients with thin to
      intermediate thickness (Breslow thickness: &lt;/=2.0 mm) melanomas, who
      underwent lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy, and whose SLN status was
      known. Sixty-four cases met the criteria and were available for analysis.
      We analyzed patient age, patient sex, mitotic rate, ulceration, tumor
      depth, and D2-40 detected LI as predictors of SLN status. RESULTS:
      Lymphatic invasion detection increased from 3.1% using hematoxylin and
      eosin only to 21.9% using D2-40. Twelve of 14 patients with D2-40 LI were
      SLN positive (positive predictive value, 85.7%). D2-40 LI was detected in
      the primary biopsy specimen of 12 of 18 patients with a positive SLN
      (sensitivity 66.7%). Of 50 patients without D2-40 LI, 44 were SLN negative
      (negative predictive value, 88.0%). Of 46 SLN-negative patients, 44 did
      not have D2-40 LI (specificity, 95.7%). LIMITATIONS: Results are
      retrospective and limited to SLN biopsy performed at one institution.
      CONCLUSIONS: On univariate and multivariate analysis, D2-40-detected LI
      was the most significant predictor of SLN status. D2-40 antibody staining
      to detect lymphatic invasion should be incorporated in routine melanoma
      biopsy evaluation.

TI  - Correlation between histologic findings on punch biopsy specimens and
      subsequent excision specimens in recurrent basal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 323-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The type of treatment for a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) depends
      on the histologic subtype. Histologic examination is usually performed on
      incisional biopsy specimens. In primary BCC, the histologic subtype is
      correctly identified with a punch biopsy in 80.7% of cases. In recurrent
      BCC, correct identification is more difficult because of discontinuous
      growth caused by scar formation. Because an aggressive histologic subtype
      has a significantly higher risk for recurrence in these tumors, the
      histologic subtype is at least as important in recurrent BCC as it is in
      primary BCC. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between histologic
      findings on punch biopsy specimens and subsequent excision specimens in
      recurrent BCC. Furthermore, we sought to clarify how often an aggressive
      histologic subtype was missed, based on the punch biopsy specimen.
      METHODS: We compared the histologic subtype in a punch biopsy specimen
      with the subsequent excision specimen in recurrent BCC. All BCCs were
      coded and judged randomly by the same dermatopathologist. RESULTS: In 24
      of 73 investigated BCCs (32.9%), the histologic subtype of the initial
      biopsy did not match with the histologic subtype of the subsequent
      excision. Of the 37 excised BCCs with an aggressive histologic subtype, 7
      (19%) were missed by the initial punch biopsy. LIMITATIONS: Intraobserver
      variation may have affected the results of this study. CONCLUSIONS:
      Discriminating tumors with any aggressive growth is relevant for
      treatment. However, in recurrent BCC, the histology of the biopsy specimen
      does not always correlate with the histology of the definitive excision.
      This may have important therapeutic implications.

      The underlying pathogenesis of morphea is not completely understood at
      this time, but ultimately results in an imbalance of collagen production
      and destruction. Evidence-based treatment options of morphea are limited
      secondary to the rarity of the disease, and the lack of universally used
      validated outcome measures. The most commonly used outcome measures are
      skin scores, computerized surface area measurement, durometer, cutometer,
      thermography, and ultrasound measurements. The Localized Scleroderma
      Cutaneous Assessment Tool is a promising recently validated skin scoring
      tool that allows differentiation between activity and damage, is sensitive
      to change, and requires no additional equipment. The most robust data in
      the treatment of morphea exists for methotrexate in combination with
      systemic steroids and ultraviolet A1.

AB  - Morphea, also known as localized scleroderma, is a rare fibrosing disorder
      of the skin and underlying tissues. Morphea is differentiated from
      systemic sclerosis based on the absence of sclerodactyly, Raynaud
      phenomenon, and nailfold capillary changes. Patients with morphea commonly
      have systemic symptoms, such as malaise, fatigue, arthralgias, and
      myalgias, as well as positive autoantibody serologies. However,
      involvement of morphea is almost uniformly limited to those tissues
      derived from the mesoderm. The underlying pathogenesis of morphea is
      incompletely understood at this time, but ultimately results in an
      imbalance of collagen production and destruction.

TI  - Surface changes of mineral trioxide aggregate after the application of
      bleaching agents: electron microscopy and an energy-dispersive X-ray
      microanalysis.
PG  - 231-4
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the
      surface structure and chemical composition after applying bleaching agents
      to completely hardened mineral trioxide aggregate. METHODS: A total of 12
      samples of MTA blocks were divided into three groups, two different
      bleaching agents, and a control group. The surface structure was observed
      using a scanning electron microscope. The changes in elemental composition
      were analyzed by an energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis (EDX) system.
      RESULTS: The surface of the MTA covered with each bleaching agent changed
      in terms of both color and structure compared with the control. EDX showed
      that both bleaching agents affected the elemental distribution. A decrease
      in Ca and an increase in Si were shown, and this tendency was especially
      pronounced in the higher hydrogen peroxide concentration group.
      CONCLUSIONS: The acidic conditions induced by bleaching agents brought
      about the deterioration of the MTA surface. These findings suggest that
      MTA is an insufficient barrier against tooth bleaching.

TI  - Inflammation triggers constitutive activity and agonist-induced negative
      responses at M(3) muscarinic receptor in dental pulp.
PG  - 185-90
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the inflammation of
      rat dental pulp induces the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR)
      constitutive receptor activity. Pulpitis was induced with bacterial
      lipolysaccharide in rat incisors dental pulp. Saturation assay with
      [(3)H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([(3)H] QNB), competitive binding with
      different mAChR antagonist subtypes, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
      activity were performed. A drastic change in expression and response to
      mAChR subtypes was observed in pulpitis. Inflamed pulp expressed high
      number of M(3) mAChR of high affinity, whereas the M(1) mAChR is the main
      subtype displayed in normal pulp. Consistent with the identification of
      the affinity constant (Ki) of M(3) and Ki of M(1) in both pulpitis and in
      normal pulps are the differences in the subtype functionality of these
      cells. In pulpitis, pilocarpine (1 x 10(-11) mol/L to 5 x 10(-9) mol/L)
      exerted an inhibitory action on NOS activity that was blocked by J 104129
      fumarate (highest selective affinity to M(3) mAChR). In normal pulps,
      pilocarpine (1 x 10(-11) mol/L to 5 x 10(-9) mol/L) has no effect. NOS
      basal activity was 5.9 times as high in pulpitis as in the normal pulp as
      a result of the activation of inducible NOS. The irreversible pulpitis
      could induce a mAChR alteration, increasing the high-affinity receptor
      density and transduction-coupling efficiency of inducible NOS activity,
      leading to a spontaneously active conformation of the receptor.
      Pilocarpine acting as an inverse agonist might be useful therapeutically
      to prevent necrosis and subsequent loss of dental pulp.

TI  - Immunohistochemical expression of Notch signaling in the lining epithelium
      of periapical cysts.
PG  - 176-80
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this study we evaluated the immunohistochemical
      expression of the receptors Notch 1 and Notch 2, the ligand Delta 1, and
      the transcription factors HES 1 and HES 5 in the epithelium of
      well-defined periapical cysts. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was carried
      out on 55 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, well-defined periapical
      cysts with minimum inflammation, obtained from the archival tissue
      database of the Department of Oral Pathology and Surgery. Western blotting
      was performed to evaluate the specificity of the anti-Notch antibody and
      the expression of Notch signaling in 5 fresh-frozen periapical cysts. The
      levels of staining intensity were estimated by the performance of a
      semiautomated image analysis system. Descriptive statistic of mean values
      obtained by computerized image analysis method was performed. RESULTS:
      Immunostaining reaction of all Notch signaling components was observed in
      the cytoplasm and/or the cytoplasmic membrane in the majority of
      epithelial cells of periapical cysts. Nuclear staining was observed
      occasionally in all cases. Notch 2 showed strong staining in 52.83% of the
      cases, followed by Notch 1 (35.85%), HES 1 and HES 5 moderate staining in
      72.73% and 57.69% of the cases, respectively, and Delta 1 weak staining in
      58.33% of the cases. No statistical correlation was found between the
      antibodies and the sex or the age of the study group. CONCLUSIONS: Notch
      is an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism that regulates cell
      fate decisions during development and postnatal life in organisms as
      diverse as worms, flies, and humans. The present observations indicate
      that Notch pathway is active downstream in the lining epithelium of
      periapical cysts, suggesting an involvement of this pathway in periapical
      cyst growth and expansion.

TI  - Comparison of periapical radiography and limited cone-beam computed
      tomography in mandibular molars for analysis of anatomical landmarks
      before apical surgery.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
      detectability and dimensions of periapical lesions, the relationship of
      the mandibular canal to the roots of the respective teeth, and the
      dimension of the buccal bone by using limited cone-beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) in comparison to conventional periapical (PA)
      radiographs for evaluation of mandibular molars before apical surgery.
      METHODS: The study comprised 38 molars with 75 roots. The type of PA
      lesion as diagnosed on PA radiographs was compared with the type of lesion
      seen on sagittal and coronal CBCT sections. The distances of the apices of
      the first mandibular molars and basal border of the PA lesion to the
      coronal lining of the mandibular canal were assessed with PA radiographs
      and corresponding sagittal and coronal CBCT images. Furthermore, coronal
      CBCT images were used to measure the distance from the apices to the
      buccal bone surface and the corresponding width of the cortical bone
      plate. RESULTS: Of 58 detected PA lesions, 15 (25.9%) lesions diagnosed
      with sagittal CBCT slices were missed with PA radiography. The distance
      between the apices and the upper border of the mandibular canal was only
      measurable in 24 of 68 radiographs (35.3%) by using PA images. The
      cortical bone wall had a mean thickness of 1.7 mm, whereas the total
      buccal bone wall (cortical and spongious) measured 5.3 mm on average.
      CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the advantages of using limited
      CBCT for treatment planning in mandibular molars before apical surgery.

TI  - Evaluation of the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells into the root canal
      space of necrotic immature teeth after clinical regenerative endodontic
      procedure.
PG  - 133-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immature teeth with open apices treated with conventional
      nonsurgical root canal treatment often have a poor prognosis as a result
      of the increased risk of fracture and susceptibility to recontamination.
      Regenerative endodontics represents a new treatment modality that focuses
      on reestablishment of pulp vitality and continued root development. This
      clinical procedure relies on the intracanal delivery of a blood clot
      (scaffold), growth factors (possibly from platelets and dentin), and stem
      cells. However, to date, the clinical presence of stem cells in the canal
      space after this procedure has not been demonstrated. The purpose of this
      clinical study was to evaluate whether regenerative endodontic procedures
      are able to deliver stem cells into the canal space of immature teeth in
      young patients and to identify the possible tissue origin for these cells.
      METHODS: After informed consent, the first appointment consisted of NaOCl
      irrigation and treatment with a triple antibiotic paste. One month later,
      the root canal space was irrigated with sterile saline, and bleeding was
      evoked with collection of samples on paper points. Real-time
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry
      were conducted to compare the gene transcripts and proteins found in the
      root canal sample with levels found in the systemic circulation. RESULTS:
      Molecular analyses of blood collected from the canal system indicated the
      significant accumulation of transcripts for the stem cell markers CD73 and
      CD105 (up to 600-fold), compared with levels found in the systemic blood.
      Furthermore, this effect was selective because there was no change in
      expression of the differentiation markers ALK-P, DSPP, ZBTB16, and CD14.
      Histologic analyses demonstrated that the delivered cells expressed both
      CD105 and STRO-1, markers for a subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells.
      CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the
      evoked-bleeding step in regenerative procedures triggers the significant
      accumulation of undifferentiated stem cells into the canal space where
      these cells might contribute to the regeneration of pulpal tissues seen
      after antibiotic paste therapy of the immature tooth with pulpal necrosis.

TI  - Toluene optic neurotoxicity: magnetic resonance imaging and pathologic
      features.
PG  - 295-8
AB  - Toluene, a colorless liquid found in glues, paints, and industrial
      products, is lipid soluble and rapidly absorbed by the lipid-rich central
      nervous system. Prolonged exposure through occupation or purposeful
      inhalation may lead to neurologic abnormalities. Two men presented with
      multifocal central nervous system defects and bilateral optic neuropathy
      of unclear etiology. After numerous diagnostic tests, including brain
      magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, hematologic studies, and in
      one patient a brain biopsy, chronic inhalation of toluene was found to be
      the cause. Timely diagnosis is important because patients may experience
      improvement in neurologic and ocular manifestations with cessation of
      exposure, whereas continued inhalant abuse or exposure can result in
      permanent loss of neurologic function.

TI  - Histologic characteristics of non-microsatellite-instable colon adenomas
      correlate with distinct molecular patterns.
PG  - 244-53
AB  - Colon carcinogenesis encompasses the stepwise accumulation of genomic
      aberrations correlated with the transition of aberrant
      crypt-adenoma-carcinoma. Recent data have revealed that, in addition to
      the microsatellite-instable phenotype, the chromosome instability pathway,
      representing four fifth of the colon carcinoma, could be involved in
      heterogeneous molecular alterations. Our project was aimed at determining
      the existence of distinct molecular subtypes in 159
      non-microsatellite-instable colon polyps and their correlation with
      histology and dysplasia, using allelotyping, MGMT promoter gene
      methylation status, and K-RAS mutation analyses. Allelic imbalance, MGMT
      methylation, and K-RAS mutations arise in 62%, 39%, and 32% of polyps,
      respectively. Only 14% of polyps had no alterations. A 2-way hierarchical
      clustering analysis of the allelic imbalances identified subgroups of
      polyps according to their allelic imbalance frequency and distribution.
      Not only tubulovillous adenoma but also high-grade adenomas were
      correlated with high global allelic imbalance frequency (P = .005 and P =
      .003), with allelic imbalance at microsatellites targeting chromosomes 1,
      6, and 9. In conclusion, the data presented in this study show that a
      large heterogeneity exists in the molecular patterns of alterations in
      precancerous colon lesions, favoring different modes of tumor initiation.
      Therefore, molecular alterations correlated with tubulovillous-type and
      high-grade dysplasia could represent targets identifying predictive
      factors of progression.

TI  - Optimization of a pharmaceutical freeze-dried product and its process
      using an experimental design approach and innovative process analyzers.
PG  - 1623-33
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine the possibilities/advantages
      of using recently introduced in-line spectroscopic process analyzers
      (Raman, NIR and plasma emission spectroscopy), within well-designed
      experiments, for the optimization of a pharmaceutical formulation and its
      freeze-drying process. The formulation under investigation was a mannitol
      (crystalline bulking agent)-sucrose (lyo- and cryoprotector) excipient
      system. The effects of two formulation variables (mannitol/sucrose ratio
      and amount of NaCl) and three process variables (freezing rate, annealing
      temperature and secondary drying temperature) upon several critical
      process and product responses (onset and duration of ice crystallization,
      onset and duration of mannitol crystallization, duration of primary
      drying, residual moisture content and amount of mannitol hemi-hydrate in
      end product) were examined using a design of experiments (DOE)
      methodology. A 2-level fractional factorial design (2(5-1)=16
      experiments+3 center points=19 experiments) was employed. All experiments
      were monitored in-line using Raman, NIR and plasma emission spectroscopy,
      which supply continuous process and product information during
      freeze-drying. Off-line X-ray powder diffraction analysis and Karl-Fisher
      titration were performed to determine the morphology and residual moisture
      content of the end product, respectively. In first instance, the results
      showed that - besides the previous described findings in De Beer et al.,
      Anal. Chem. 81 (2009) 7639-7649 - Raman and NIR spectroscopy are able to
      monitor the product behavior throughout the complete annealing step during
      freeze-drying. The DOE approach allowed predicting the optimum combination
      of process and formulation parameters leading to the desired responses.
      Applying a mannitol/sucrose ratio of 4, without adding NaCl and processing
      the formulation without an annealing step, using a freezing rate of 0.9
      degrees C/min and a secondary drying temperature of 40 degrees C resulted
      in efficient freeze-drying supplying end products with a residual moisture
      content below 2% and a mannitol hemi-hydrate content below 20%. Finally,
      using Monte Carlo simulations it became possible to determine how varying
      the factor settings around their optimum still leads to fulfilled response
      criteria, herewith having an idea about the probability to exceed the
      acceptable response limits. This multi-dimensional combination and
      interaction of input variables (factor ranges) leading to acceptable
      response criteria with an acceptable probability reflects the process
      design space.

TI  - Evaluation of oxygen pressurized microwave-assisted digestion of botanical
      materials using diluted nitric acid.
PG  - 1324-8
AB  - The feasibility of diluted nitric acid solutions for microwave-assisted
      decomposition of botanical samples in closed vessels was evaluated. Oxygen
      pressurized atmosphere was used to improve the digestion efficiency and
      Al, Ca, K, Fe, Mg and Na were determined in digests by inductively coupled
      plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). Efficiency of digestion
      was evaluated taking into account the residual carbon content (RCC) and
      residual acidity in digests. Samples were digested using nitric acid
      solutions (2, 3, 7, and 14 mol L(-1) HNO(3)) and the effect of gas phase
      composition inside the reaction vessels by purging the vessel with Ar
      (inert atmosphere, 1 bar), air (20% of oxygen, 1 bar) and pure O(2) (100%
      of oxygen, 1 bar) was evaluated. The influence of oxygen pressure was
      studied using pressures of 5, 10, 15 and 20 bar. It was demonstrated that
      a diluted nitric acid solution as low as 3 mol L(-1) was suitable for an
      efficient digestion of sample masses up to 500 mg of botanical samples
      using 5 bar of oxygen pressure. The residual acidities in final digests
      were lower than 45% in relation to the initial amount of acid used for
      digestion (equivalent to 1.3 mol L(-1) HNO(3)). The accuracy of the
      proposed procedure was evaluated using certified reference materials of
      olive leaves, apple leaves, peach leaves and pine needles. Using the
      optimized conditions for sample digestion, the results obtained were in
      agreement with certified values. The limit of quantification was improved
      up to a factor of 14.5 times for the analytes evaluated. In addition, the
      proposed procedure was in agreement with the recommendations of the green
      chemistry once it was possible to obtain relatively high digestion
      efficiency (RCC&lt;5%) using only diluted HNO(3), which is important to
      minimize the generation of laboratory residues.

TI  - Hepaticoduodenostomy vs hepaticojejunostomy for reconstruction after
      resection of choledochal cyst.
PG  - 209-13
AB  - PURPOSE: Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) is currently the favored
      reconstructive procedure after resection of choledochal cysts.
      Hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) has been argued to be more physiologically and
      technically easier but is feared to have associated complications. Here we
      compare outcomes of the 2 procedures. METHODS: A retrospective chart
      review identified 59 patients who underwent choledochal cyst resection
      within our institution from 1999 to 2009. Demographic and outcome data
      were compared using t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Pearson chi(2)
      tests. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients underwent repair of choledochal cyst.
      Biliary continuity was restored by HD in 39 (66%) and by HJ in 20 (34%).
      Open HD patients required less total operative time than HJ patients (3.9
      vs 5.1 hours, P = .013), tolerated a diet faster (4.8 days compared with
      6.1 days, P = .08), and had a shorter hospital stay (7.05 days for HD vs
      9.05 days for HJ, P = .12). Complications were more common in HJ (HD =
      7.6%, HJ = 20%, P = .21). Three patients required reoperation after HJ,
      but only one patient required reoperation after HD for a stricture (HD =
      2.5%, HJ = 20%, P = .037). CONCLUSIONS: In this series, HD required less
      operative time, allowed faster recovery of bowel function, and produced
      fewer complications requiring reoperation.

TI  - The significance of first rib fractures in children.
PG  - 169-72
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine if first rib fractures
      are associated with an increased incidence of thoracic vascular injury in
      pediatric patients. METHODS: The medical records of all children diagnosed
      with a first rib fracture or a central vascular injury after blunt trauma
      treated at a state-designated level 1 pediatric trauma center from 2000 to
      2009 were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-three children (0.27% of patients;
      mean age, 10.9 +/- 0.9 years) were identified with either a first rib
      fracture or thoracic vascular injury owing to blunt trauma. Thirty-two
      children had a first rib fracture, and only 1 child (3%) had significant
      thoracic vascular injury. Mediastinal abnormalities (indistinct aortic
      knob) were identified in 3 children, 2 with first rib fracture on initial
      chest radiograph. Despite a normal cardiovascular examination result, 25
      (74%) children with a normal mediastinum on screening chest radiograph
      underwent computed tomography. No child with a normal mediastinum on
      initial chest radiograph was found to have associated intrathoracic
      injuries requiring further intervention. In children with first rib
      fractures and a normal mediastinum by screening chest x-ray, the negative
      predictive value for thoracic vascular injury was 100%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Children with first rib fractures without mediastinal abnormality on chest
      radiograph require no further workup for thoracic vascular injury.

TI  - Necrotizing enterocolitis is associated with neonatal intestinal injury.
PG  - 81-5
AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesized that a subset of premature newborns has
      subclinical, intestinal mucosal compromise that predisposes to the
      development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) days or weeks later.
      METHODS: Fifty-five newborns of 23 to 36 weeks' gestational age were
      identified, and urine was collected over the first 90 hours of life. The
      urinary concentration of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP(u)),
      a sensitive marker for intestinal injury, was determined. The diagnosis of
      NEC was based upon clinical condition, pathology, and/or imaging findings.
      RESULTS: Neonatal iFABP(u) exceeded 800 pg/mL in 27 subjects, including 9
      of 9 who subsequently developed stage 2 or 3 NEC. This degree of iFABP(u)
      elevation, but not asphyxia, was significantly associated with the
      development of NEC (P &lt; .01). CONCLUSION: In this population of premature
      newborns, there was a substantial incidence of intestinal mucosal
      compromise. All infants who subsequently developed stage 2 or 3 NEC had an
      elevated iFABP(u). This finding suggests a model for the pathogenesis of
      some cases of NEC, whereby perinatal mucosal injury predisposes to further
      damage when feedings are initiated. In addition, neonatal iFABP(u)
      assessment may represent a tool to identify infants at the highest risk
      for NEC and allow for the institution of focused, preventive measures.

TI  - Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma (Dabska tumor): underrecognized
      malignant tumor in childhood.
PG  - e25-8
AB  - Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma, or Dabska tumor, was first
      presented in 1969 by Maria Dabska where she presented cases occurring in 6
      children. The tumor was described as being a low-grade angiosarcoma
      characterized by papillary endovascular proliferations of atypical
      endothelial cells and anastomosing vascular channels within the dermis.
      Since its original description, only 30 case reports have been written
      describing the varying presentation, clinical course, and histopathology
      of this tumor. This case report documents the presentation and management
      of endovascular papillary angioendothelioma in a young male and reviews
      the current literature. Because more cases of EPAs are reported, perhaps a
      more standard approach to accurate diagnosis and treatment with surgical
      intervention and pathologic recognition via microscopy and
      immunohistochemistry can be determined.

TI  - Inhibition of IgE-mediated secretion from human basophils with a highly
      selective Bruton's tyrosine kinase, Btk, inhibitor.
AB  - The study of receptor-mediated signaling in human basophils is often
      limited by the availability of selective pharmacological agents. The early
      signaling reaction mediated by FcepsilonRI aggregation is thought to
      require the activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (btk), an enzyme that has
      been identified as important in B cells signaling because mutations lead
      to X-linked agammaglobulinemia. This study uses the btk selective
      irreversible inhibitor, PCI-32765, to explore the role of btk in a variety
      of functions associated with the activation of human basophils. Nine
      endpoints of basophil activation were examined: induced cell surface
      expression of CD63, CD203c, CD11b; induced secretion of histamine, LTC4,
      IL-4 and IL-13; the cytosolic calcium response; and the induced loss of
      syk kinase. Four stimuli were examined; anti-IgE antibody,
      formyl-met-leu-phe (FMLP), C5a and IL-3. For stimulation with anti-IgE,
      PCI-32765 inhibited CD63, histamine, LTC4 and IL-4 secretion with an IC50
      of 3-6nM (with 100% inhibition at 50nM) and it inhibited CD203c and CD11b
      and the cytosolic calcium response with and IC50 of 30-40nM. Fifty percent
      occupancy of btk with PCI-32765 occurred at ~10nM. Consistent with btk
      functioning downstream or in parallel to syk activation, PCI-32765 did not
      inhibit the loss of syk induced by anti-IgE in overnight cultures.
      Finally, PCI-32765 did not significantly inhibit basophil activation by
      FMLP or C5a and did not inhibit IL-13 release induced by IL-3. These
      results suggest that btk is specifically required for IgE-mediated
      activation of human basophils.

TI  - Oral administration of ginsenoside Rh1 inhibits the development of atopic
      dermatitis-like skin lesions induced by oxazolone in hairless mice.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the inhibitive effect of ginsenoside Rh1
      on oxazolone-induced atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in hairless mice.
      Oral administration of ginsenoside Rh1 improved clinical symptoms, and it
      was confirmed by histophathological analysis. In ginsenoside Rh1 (20mg/kg)
      group, ear swellings and ear weights were significantly lower than the
      control group. Moreover, elevation of IL-6 and total IgE levels in serum
      were suppressed by ginsenoside Rh1 (20mg/kg). In addition, ginsenoside Rh1
      (20mg/kg) significantly increased mRNA expression of IFNgamma and Foxp3,
      and slightly decreased IL-4 expression in draining lymph nodes. The
      results suggest that ginsenoside Rh1 can alleviate inflammatory symptoms
      in atopic dermatitis (AD) by reduction of IgE and IL-6 levels in
      peripheral blood, increase of Foxp3 expression in draining lymph nodes and
      suppression of inflammation in skin regions. Indeed, ginsenoside Rh1
      exhibited therapeutic possibility in immune disorders.

TI  - Design and Validation of the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium
      Histologic Assessment System for Cholestasis in Infancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Pathologists participating in the National Institutes
      of Health-sponsored Biliary Atresia Research Consortium (BARC) developed
      and then evaluated a standardized system for histologic reporting of liver
      biopsies from infants with cholestasis. METHODS: A set of 97 anonymous
      liver biopsy samples was sent to 10 pathologists at BARC centers. A
      semiquantitative scoring system that had 16 histologic features was
      developed and then used by the pathologists, who had no knowledge of
      clinical history, imaging results, or laboratory data. Interobserver
      agreement was evaluated statistically. Agreement on scoring of each
      feature and on the pathologists' diagnosis, compared with the final
      clinical diagnosis, was evaluated by using weighted kappa statistics.
      RESULTS: There was moderate to substantial interobserver agreement in
      identification of bile plugs in ducts, giant-cell transformation,
      extramedullary hematopoiesis, and bile duct proliferation. The
      pathologists' diagnosis of obstruction in clinically proven cases of
      biliary atresia (BA) ranged from 79%-98%, with a positive predictive value
      of 90.7%. Histologic features that best predicted BA, on the basis of
      logistic regression, included bile duct proliferation, portal fibrosis,
      and absence of sinusoidal fibrosis (each P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The BARC
      histologic assessment system identified features of liver biopsies from
      cholestatic infants, with good interobserver agreement, that might be used
      in diagnosis and determination of prognosis. The system diagnosed BA with
      a high level of sensitivity and identified infants with biliary
      obstruction with reasonable interobserver agreement. However,
      distinguishing between BA and disorders such as total parenteral
      nutrition-associated liver disease and alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency is
      not possible without adequate clinical information.

TI  - Functional analysis of the chicken PPARgamma gene 5'-flanking region and
      C/EBPalpha-mediated gene regulation.
PG  - 297-303
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and
      CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) are the master
      regulators of adipogenesis. The regulatory mechanism of PPARgamma and
      C/EBPalpha gene expression is clear in mammals, however, little is known
      in chicken. The aim of the present study was to characterize chicken
      PPARgamma promoter and investigate whether PPARgamma could be regulated by
      C/EBPalpha in chickens. A 2-kb nucleotide sequence upstream of the start
      codon of chicken PPARgamma gene was cloned and characterized by using
      bioinformatics and experimental approaches. This 2-kb promoter region
      exhibited strong promoter activity in DF1 cells. The reporter gene assay
      showed that the chicken C/EBPalpha could activate PPARgamma gene promoter.
      Further study by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and mutational
      analysis revealed that the chicken C/EBPalpha could directly bind to and
      regulate the PPARgamma gene promoter. Our results demonstrate that
      PPARgamma can be directly regulated by C/EBPalpha in chickens.

TI  - Receptor specific crosstalk and modulation of signaling upon
      heterodimerization between beta(1)-adrenergic receptor and somatostatin
      receptor-5.
AB  - In the present study we describe heterodimerization, trafficking, coupling
      to adenylyl cyclase and signaling in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with
      human-somatostatin receptor 5 (hSSTR5) and beta(1)-adrenergic receptor
      (beta(1)AR). hSSTR5/beta(1)AR exists as heterodimers in basal conditions
      which was further enhanced upon synergistic activation of both receptors.
      Activation of either beta(1)AR or hSSTR5 displayed dissociation of
      heterodimerization. In cotransfectants, beta(1)AR effect on cAMP was
      predominant; however, blocking beta(1)AR with antagonist resulted in 60%
      inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP in the presence of hSSTR5
      agonists. cAMP/PKA pathway in cotransfected cells was regulated in
      receptor-specific manner, in contrast, the status of pERK1/2 and pPI3K/AKT
      was predominantly regulated by hSSTR5. The expression levels of
      phosphorylated NFAT remained unchanged indicating blockade of
      calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT,
      the process predominantly regulated by pJNK in SSTR5 dependent manner.
      Taken together, the functional consequences of results described here
      might have relevance in the cardiovascular system where SSTR and AR
      subtypes play important roles.

TI  - A highly optimized DNA vaccine confers complete protective immunity
      against high-dose lethal lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus challenge.
AB  - Protection against infection is the hallmark of immunity and the basis of
      effective vaccination. For a variety of reasons there is a great demand to
      develop new, safer and more effective vaccine platforms. In this regard,
      while 'first-generation' DNA vaccines were poorly immunogenic, new genetic
      'optimization' strategies and the application of in vivo electroporation
      (EP) have dramatically boosted their potency. We developed a highly
      optimized plasmid DNA vaccine that expresses the lymphocytic
      choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) nucleocapsid protein (NP) and evaluated it
      using the LCMV challenge model, a gold standard for studying infection and
      immunity. When administered intramuscularly with EP, robust NP-specific
      cellular and humoral immune responses were elicited, the magnitudes of
      which approached those following acute LCMV infection. Furthermore, these
      responses were capable of providing 100% protection against a high-dose,
      normally lethal virus challenge. This is the first non-infectious vaccine
      conferring complete protective immunity up to 8 weeks after vaccination
      and demonstrates the potential of 'next-generation' DNA vaccines.

TI  - Pandemic H1N1 vaccine requires the use of an adjuvant to protect against
      challenge in naive ferrets.
AB  - In the context of an A/H1N1 influenza pandemic situation, this study
      demonstrates that heterologous vaccination with an AS03-adjuvanted
      2008/2009 seasonal trivalent and pandemic H5N1 monovalent split vaccine
      conferred partial protection in influenza-naive ferrets after challenge
      with the influenza pandemic H1N1 A/The Netherlands/602/09 virus. Further,
      unlike saline control and non-adjuvanted vaccine, it was shown that
      immunization of naive ferrets with an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1
      A/California/7/09 influenza split vaccine induced increased antibody
      response and enhanced protection against the challenge strain, including
      significant reduction in viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract and
      reduced lung pathology post-challenge. These results show the need for
      vaccination with the adjuvanted vaccine to fully protect against viral
      replication and influenza disease in unprimed ferrets.

TI  - Evaluation of Cryptococcus neoformans galactoxylomannan-protein conjugate
      as vaccine candidate against murine cryptococcosis.
PG  - 1891-8
AB  - Galactoxylomannan (GalXM) is a complex polysaccharide produced by the
      human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans that mediates profound
      immunological derangements in murine models. GalXM is essentially
      non-immunogenic and produces immune paralysis in mice. Previous studies
      have attempted to enhance immunogenicity by conjugating GalXM to a protein
      carrier, but only transient antibody responses were elicited. Here we
      report the generation of two GalXM conjugates with bovine serum albumin
      (BSA) and protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis, respectively,
      using 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) as the
      cyanylating reagent. Both conjugates induced potent and sustained antibody
      responses as detected by both cross antigen-based and CovaLink direct
      ELISAs. We confirmed the specificity of the response to GalXM by
      inhibition ELISA and immunofluorescence. The isotype composition analysis
      revealed that IgG and IgM were abundant in the immune sera against GalXM,
      consistent with the induction of a T cell-dependent response. IgG1 was the
      predominant IgG subclass against GalXM, while immunization with Quil A as
      adjuvant elicited a significantly higher production of IgG2a than with
      Freund's adjuvant. Immune sera were not opsonic for C. neoformans and
      there was no survival difference between immune and non-immune mice
      challenged with C. neoformans. These results demonstrated the
      effectiveness of the GalXM-protein conjugate to induce robust immune
      responses although no evidence was obtained that such responses
      contributed to host defense.

TI  - Effect of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta-mediated presenilin 1
      phosphorylation on amyloid beta production is negatively regulated by
      insulin receptor cleavage.
AB  - Presenilin 1 (PS1), a causative molecule of familial Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), is known to be an unprimed substrate of glycogen synthase kinase 3
      beta (GSK3beta) [Twomey and McCarthy (2006) FEBS Lett 580:4015-4020] and
      is phosphorylated at serine 353, 357 residues in its cytoplasmic loop
      region [Kirschenbaum et al. (2001) J Biol Chem 276:7366-7375]. In this
      report, we investigated the effect of PS1 phosphorylation on AD
      pathophysiology and obtained two important results-PS1 phosphorylation
      increased amyloid beta (Abeta) 42/40 ratio, and PS1 phosphorylation was
      enhanced in the human AD brains. Interestingly, we demonstrated that PS1
      phosphorylation promoted insulin receptor (IR) cleavage and the IR
      intracellular domain (IR ICD) generated by gamma-secretase led to a marked
      transactivation of Akt (PKB), which down-regulated GSK3beta activity.
      Thus, the cleavage of IR by gamma-secretase can inhibit PS1
      phosphorylation in the long run. Taken together, our findings indicate
      that PS1 phosphorylation at serine 353, 357 residues can play a pivotal
      role in the pathology of AD and that the dysregulation of this mechanism
      may be causally associated with its pathology.

TI  - Time series analysis of postural responses to combined visual pitch and
      support surface tilt.
PG  - 138-42
AB  - The purpose of using time-series analyses is to provide interpretation of
      information on curves or functions, such as dynamic, biomechanical data.
      We evaluated the application of one method of time-series analysis for
      assessing changes in postural responses when exposed to a continuously
      rotating visual field combined with a tilted support surface. Functional
      Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) was applied to center of mass (CoM)
      trajectories collected from 22 young adults (20-39 y.o.) on a fixed
      surface or following a 3 degree (30 degrees /s) dorsiflexion tilt of the
      support surface combined with continuous upward or downward pitch rotation
      of the visual field at 30 and 45 degrees /s. The usefulness of this
      analytical tool is that each curve is treated as a distinct observation by
      itself, allowing for traditional PCA to be applied to the analysis of
      curves. Results of the fPCA highlighted 5 distinct time periods in the CoM
      curves that explained 91% of the variability in the data. These periods in
      which the young adults altered their CoM in response to visual field
      motion would not have been identified if we had relied on the onset and
      offset of the transient disturbance to distinguish responses. Young adults
      significantly displaced their CoM in response to visual motion over both
      the period of support surface tilt and while the support surface returned
      to a neutral position. Our results indicate that fPCA is a viable method
      when applied to the small but complex changes that emerge in postural data
      and might allow for a better understanding of time dependent processes
      occurring with pathology and intervention.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of yerba mate extract (Ilex paraguariensis)
      ameliorate insulin resistance in mice with high fat diet-induced obesity.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of yerba mate
      extract upon markers of insulin resistance and inflammatory markers in
      mice with high fat diet-induced obesity. The mice were introduced to
      either standard or high fat diets. After 12 weeks on a high fat diet, mice
      were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions, water or
      yerba mate extract at 1.0gkg(-1). After treatment, glucose blood level and
      hepatic and soleus muscle insulin response were evaluated. Serum levels of
      TNF-alpha and IL-6 were evaluated by ELISA, liver tissue was examined to
      determine the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and iNOS, and the nuclear
      translocation of NF-kappaB was determined by an electrophoretic mobility
      shift assay. Our data show improvements in both the basal glucose blood
      levels and in the response to insulin administration in the treated
      animals. The molecular analysis of insulin signalling revealed a
      restoration of hepatic and muscle insulin substrate receptor (IRS)-1 and
      AKT phosphorylation. Our data show that the high fat diet caused an
      up-regulation of the TNF-alpha, IL-6, and iNOS genes. Although after
      intervention with yerba mate extract the expression levels of those genes
      returned to baseline through the NF-kappaB pathway, these results could
      also be secondary to the weight loss observed. In conclusion, our results
      indicate that yerba mate has a potential anti-inflammatory effect.
      Additionally, these data demonstrate that yerba mate inhibits hepatic and
      muscle TNF-alpha and restores hepatic insulin signalling in mice with high
      fat diet-induced obesity.

TI  - Human growth hormone receptor gene expression is regulated by Gfi-1/1b and
      GAGA cis-elements.
AB  - Human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) gene regulation is complex: mRNAs are
      transcribed from multiple variant (V) 5'UTR exons, several ubiquitously
      while others only in the postnatal hepatocyte. The liver-specific V1 exon
      promoter contains Gfi-1/1b repressor sites adjacent to a GAGA box, a GH
      response element (GHRE) in several mammalian genes. GAGA boxes are also
      present in the ubiquitously expressing V3 exon promoter. Heterologous
      sites in bovine, ovine and murine GHR genes suggest conserved roles. GAGA
      factor stimulated V1 and V3 promoters while Gfi-1/1b repressed basal and
      GAF-stimulated V1 transcription. HGH treatment of HepG2 cells resulted in
      a new complex forming with V3 GAGA elements, suggesting a functional GHRE.
      Data suggest liver-specific V1 transcription is regulated by inhibitory
      Gfi-1/1b and stimulatory GAGA cis-elements and Gfi-1/1b may control the
      lack of V1 expression in fetal liver, hepatic tumours and non-hepatic
      tissues. In addition, hGH may regulate hGHR expression through V3 GAGA
      boxes.

TI  - Regulation of FOXO protein stability via ubiquitination and proteasome
      degradation.
AB  - Forkhead box O-class (FOXO) proteins are evolutionally conserved
      transcription factors. They belong to a family of proteins consisting of
      FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4 and FOXO6 in humans. Increasing evidence suggests
      that FOXO proteins function as tumor suppressors by transcriptionally
      regulating expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
      DNA repair and oxidative stress resistance. Activation of various protein
      kinases, including Akt, IkappaB kinase (IKK) and ERK, leads to
      phosphorylation of FOXO proteins and their ubiquitination mediated by E3
      ligases such as SKP2 and MDM2 in human primary tumors and cancer cell
      lines. As a result, the tumor suppressor functions of FOXO proteins are
      either diminished or abrogated due to their ubiquitination-proteasome
      degradation, thereby favoring cell transformation, proliferation and
      survival. Thus, ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of FOXO proteins
      play an important role in tumorigenesis and represent a viable target for
      cancer treatment. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled:
      P13K-AKT-FOxO axis in cancer and aging.

TI  - Interleukin-6, a mental cytokine.
AB  - Almost a quarter of a century ago, interleukin-6 (IL-6) was discovered as
      an inflammatory cytokine involved in B cell differentiation. Today, IL-6
      is recognized to be a highly versatile cytokine, with pleiotropic actions
      not only in immune cells, but also in other cell types, such as cells of
      the central nervous system (CNS). The first evidence implicating IL-6 in
      brain-related processes originated from its dysregulated expression in
      several neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's
      disease and Parkinson's disease. In addition, IL-6 was shown to be
      involved in multiple physiological CNS processes such as neuron
      homeostasis, astrogliogenesis and neuronal differentiation. The molecular
      mechanisms underlying IL-6 functions in the brain have only recently
      started to emerge. In this review, an overview of the latest discoveries
      concerning the actions of IL-6 in the nervous system is provided. The
      central position of IL-6 in the neuroinflammatory reaction pattern, and
      more specifically, the role of IL-6 in specific neurodegenerative
      processes, which accompany Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and
      excitotoxicity, are discussed. It is evident that IL-6 has a dichotomic
      action in the CNS, displaying neurotrophic properties on the one hand, and
      detrimental actions on the other. This is in agreement with its central
      role in neuroinflammation, which evolved as a beneficial process, aimed at
      maintaining tissue homeostasis, but which can become malignant when
      exaggerated. In this perspective, it is not surprising that 'well-meant'
      actions of IL-6 are often causing harm instead of leading to recovery.

TI  - alpha-Synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase-2, and manganese in the
      pathogenesis of parkinson disease.
AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder. It is
      characterized by bradykinesia, postural instability, resting tremor, and
      rigidity associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in
      the substantia nigra pars compacta. Another pathological hallmark of PD is
      the presence of alpha-synuclein proteiniacous inclusions, known as Lewy
      bodies and Lewy neurites, in some of the remaining dopaminergic neurons.
      Mounting evidence indicates that both genetic and environmental factors
      contribute to the etiology of PD. For example, genetic mutations
      (duplications, triplications or missense mutations) in the alpha-synuclein
      gene can lead to PD, but even in these patients, age-dependent
      physiological changes or environmental exposures appear to be involved in
      disease presentation. Several additional alterations in many other genes
      have been established to either cause or increase the risk of parkinson
      disease. More specifically, autosomal dominant missense mutations in the
      gene for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2/PARK8) are the most common
      known cause of PD. Recently it was shown that G2019S, the most common
      diseasing-causing mutant of LRRK2, has dramatic effects on the kinase
      activity of LRRK2: while activity of wild-type LRRK2 is inhibited by
      manganese, the G2019S mutation abrogates this inhibition. Based on the in
      vitro kinetic properties of LRRK2 in the presence of manganese, we
      proposed that LRRK2 may be a sensor of cytoplasmic manganese levels and
      that the G2019S mutant has lost this function. This finding, alongside a
      growing number of studies demonstrating an interaction between
      PD-associated proteins and manganese, suggest that dysregulation of
      neuronal manganese homeostasis over a lifetime can play an important role
      in the etiology of PD.

TI  - Novel high-throughput assay to assess cellular manganese levels in a
      striatal cell line model of Huntington's disease confirms a deficit in
      manganese accumulation.
AB  - In spite of the essentiality of manganese (Mn) as a trace element
      necessary for a variety of physiological processes, Mn in excess
      accumulates in the brain and has been associated with dysfunction and
      degeneration of the basal ganglia. Despite the high sensitivity, limited
      chemical interference, and multi-elemental advantages of traditional
      methods for measuring Mn levels, they lack the feasibility to assess Mn
      transport dynamics in a high-throughput manner. Our lab has previously
      reported decreased net Mn accumulation in a mutant striatal cell line
      model of Huntington's disease (STHdh(Q111/Q111)) relative to wild-type
      following Mn exposure. To evaluate Mn transport dynamics in these striatal
      cell lines, we have developed a high-throughput fluorescence-quenching
      extraction assay (Cellular Fura-2 Manganese Extraction Assay - CFMEA).
      CFMEA utilizes changes in fura-2 fluorescence upon excitation at 360nm
      (Ca(2+) isosbestic point) and emission at 535nm, as an indirect
      measurement of total cellular Mn content. Here, we report the
      establishment, development, and application of CFMEA. Specifically, we
      evaluate critical extraction and assay conditions (e.g. extraction buffer,
      temperature, and fura-2 concentration) required for efficient extraction
      and quantitative detection of cellular Mn from cultured cells. Mn
      concentrations can be derived from quenching of fura-2 fluorescence with
      standard curves based on saturation one-site specific binding kinetics.
      Importantly, we show that extracted calcium and magnesium concentrations
      below 10muM have negligible influence on measurements of Mn by fura-2.
      CFMEA is able to accurately measure extracted Mn levels from cultured
      striatal cells over a range of at least 0.1-10muM. We have used two
      independent Mn supplementation approaches to validate the quantitative
      accuracy of CFMEA over a 0-200muM cellular Mn-exposure range. Finally, we
      have utilized CFMEA to experimentally confirm a deficit in net Mn
      accumulation in the mutant HD striatal cell line versus wild-type cells.
      To conclude, we have developed and applied a novel assay to assess Mn
      transport dynamics in cultured striatal cell lines. CFMEA provides a rapid
      means of evaluating Mn transport kinetics in cellular toxicity and disease
      models.

TI  - Synthesis and characterization of gum acacia inspired silica hybrid
      xerogels for mercury(II) adsorption.
AB  - In a sol-gel process, gum acacia inspired silica xerogels have been
      synthesized from tetraethylorthosilicate. Besides showing
      photoluminescence under ultraviolet excitation, the hybrid xerogels were
      very efficient in capturing mercury(II) from synthetic solution. To
      synthesize the optimum sample (in terms of Hg(II) uptake), different
      ratios of H(2)O:TEOS:EtOH were taken at fixed GA and catalyst
      concentrations where 4:1:1 ratio was found to be most favorable.
      Calcination in air further enhanced the mercury binding capacity of this
      sample. Optimum sample (H4) was obtained on calcination of the gel at 600
      degrees C. The hybrids have been structurally characterized using Infrared
      spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermo
      gravimetric analysis, photoluminescence spectroscopy and
      Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. In a preliminary batch adsorption
      experiment, H4 was evaluated to be highly efficient in the removal Hg(II)
      from synthetic aqueous solution.

TI  - Aged dogs demonstrate both increased sensitivity to scopolamine impairment
      and decreased muscarinic receptor density.
AB  - Memory deficits associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease have been
      linked to cholinergic dysfunction. The present study sought to extend this
      relationship to the aged canine model by comparing the effects of the
      muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine on recent memory
      performance and by examining muscarinic receptor density in aged and young
      dogs. Scopolamine (15mug/kg; SC) was administered prior to testing young
      (M=2.8years) and aged (M=13.0years) dogs on a
      delayed-non-matching-to-position task (DNMP). Scopolamine significantly
      impaired performance of aged, but not young dogs. Muscarinic receptor
      density was assessed autoradiographically using the non-selective
      radioligand [(3)H]quinuclidinylbenzilate. Aged dogs (M=14.1years) showed
      significantly decreased density of muscarinic receptors in all brain
      regions examined except the cerebellum compared to young dogs
      (M=3.7years). The results are consistent with those seen in aged humans
      and Alzheimer's patients and support the hypothesis of age-dependent
      cholinergic dysfunction in the dog, although this was not directly
      determined in the current study. These findings extend the canine model by
      demonstrating that markers of cholinergic hypofunction, in addition to the
      natural cognitive decline and amyloid pathology previously noted, are seen
      in aging. Collectively, this supports the use of the aged dog as a model
      for examining early pathological events in the development of Alzheimer's
      disease.

TI  - LPS-mediated production of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids
      in whole blood samples: Biological effects of +896A/G TLR4 polymorphism in
      a Sicilian population of healthy subjects.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the principal mediators of rapid microbial
      recognition: the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor TLR4 seems to have a
      paradigmatic role. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR4
      gene, such as +896A/G, known to attenuate receptor signaling, have been
      described. The +896A/G SNP is significantly less frequent in patients with
      myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease or prostate cancer, whereas it
      is overrepresented in centenarians. To clarify and confirm the biological
      effects of +896A/G SNP and its role in the pathophysiology of age-related
      diseases and longevity, we assessed the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10
      and eicosanoids (LTB4 and PGE2) in LPS-stimulated whole blood samples in
      vitro of 50 young healthy Sicilians, screened for the presence of this
      SNP. To evaluate the possible influence of SNPs in PTGS2 and 5-Lo genes on
      eicosanoid production, the enrolled individuals were also genotyped for
      -765G/C PTGS2 and -1708G/A 5-Lo SNPs. Both pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      eicosanoids were significantly lower in carriers bearing the TLR4
      mutation, whereas the anti-inflammatory IL-10 values were higher. On the
      basis of data reported herein, some suggestions can be drawn. First,
      pathogen load, by interacting with the host genotype, determines the type
      and intensity of inflammatory responses, according to the pro-inflammatory
      status and tissue injury, implicated in the pathophysiology of major
      age-related diseases. Second, adequate control of inflammatory response
      might reduce the risk of these diseases, and, reciprocally, might increase
      the chance of extended survival in an environment with reduced antigen
      (that is, pathogen) load.

TI  - Time and spatial attention: Effects of prism adaptation on temporal
      deficits in brain damaged patients.
AB  - Growing evidence indicates that the representations of space and time
      interact in the brain but the exact neural correlates of such interaction
      remain unknown. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies show that
      processing of temporal information engages a distributed network in the
      right hemisphere and suggest a link between deficits in spatial attention
      and deficits in time perception. In the present study we used the
      procedure of prismatic adaptation (PA) to directionally manipulate spatial
      attention in order to explore the effect of attentional deviation on time
      perception in patients with right (RBD) vs. left (LBD) brain damage. In a
      first experiment, two groups of RBD and LBD patients and two groups of
      age-matched healthy subjects were submitted to a time reproduction task
      before and after rightward or leftward PA (between-group design). In a
      second experiment RBD and LBD patients were submitted to the same task,
      before and after rightward and leftward PA (within-group design). RBD but
      not LBD patients presented a time deficit with a clear tendency to
      underestimate the real time. PA inducing leftward attentional deviation
      biased time perception toward an underestimation in RBD patients and
      controls, while it was ineffective in LBD patients. PA inducing a
      rightward attentional deviation failed to affect time perception in either
      group. These results underline the effects of PA on temporal deficits in
      brain damaged patients. The novel finding is that, while a right
      hemispheric network is critical for explicit timing, a left hemispheric
      network is necessary for mediating the effects of prismatic adaptation on
      spatial and temporal perception.

TI  - The Structural and Dynamic Response of MAGI-1 PDZ1 with Noncanonical
      Domain Boundaries to the Binding of Human Papillomavirus E6.
PG  - 745-63
AB  - PDZ domains are protein interaction domains that are found in cytoplasmic
      proteins involved in signaling pathways and subcellular transport. Their
      roles in the control of cell growth, cell polarity, and cell adhesion in
      response to cell contact render this family of proteins targets during the
      development of cancer. Targeting of these network hubs by the oncoprotein
      E6 of &quot;high-risk&quot; human papillomaviruses (HPVs) serves to effect the
      efficient disruption of cellular processes. Using NMR, we have solved the
      three-dimensional solution structure of an extended construct of the
      second PDZ domain of MAGI-1 (MAGI-1 PDZ1) alone and bound to a peptide
      derived from the C-terminus of HPV16 E6, and we have characterized the
      changes in backbone dynamics and hydrogen bonding that occur upon binding.
      The binding event induces quenching of high-frequency motions in the
      C-terminal tail of the PDZ domain, which contacts the peptide upstream of
      the canonical X-[T/S]-X-[L/V] binding motif. Mutations designed in the
      C-terminal flanking region of the PDZ domain resulted in a significant
      decrease in binding affinity for E6 peptides. This detailed analysis
      supports the notion of a global response of the PDZ domain to the binding
      event, with effects propagated to distal sites, and reveals unexpected
      roles for the sequences flanking the canonical PDZ domain boundaries.

TI  - Structural Investigation of PsbO from Plant and Cyanobacterial Photosystem
      II.
AB  - The manganese-stabilizing protein PsbO is associated with the luminal side
      of thylakoids close to the redox-active Mn(4)Ca cluster at the
      catalytically active site of photosystem II (PSII). PsbO is believed to
      increase the efficiency of oxygen evolution and to stabilize the Mn(4)Ca
      cluster against photoinhibition. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we
      investigated the low-resolution structure of wild-type spinach PsbO and
      that of chimeric spinach PsbO fused with maltose-binding protein.
      Small-angle X-ray scattering data revealed that both proteins are
      monomeric in solution, and that plant and cyanobacterial PsbO have similar
      structures. We show a highly efficient expression system that allows
      recombinant production of the active wild type and the chimeric PsbO from
      spinach and cyanobacteria, with yields compatible with biophysical and
      structural studies. The binding of spinach PsbO fused with maltose-binding
      protein to PSII depleted of extrinsic subunits (PSII-DeltapsbO,P,Q) was
      confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
      mass spectrometry. The reconstituted PSII was shown to have similar oxygen
      evolution rates as obtained with wild-type spinach PsbO.

TI  - IGF-II and MMP9 as surgical repair indicators of ventricular septal
      defects.
PG  - 761-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth
      factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and human growth hormone (h-GH) have
      been recognized as therapeutic targets for the heart disease therapy. The
      bioavailability and actions of insulin-like growth factors-II (IGF-II) and
      matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) are important for embryonic development
      and cardiomyocyte differentiation as well. However, the clinical
      manifestations following the change in the serum IGF-II and MMP9 in
      infants with isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) undergoing surgical
      repair have not been clearly defined. STUDY DESIGN: Serum samples were
      collected from 72 infants: Twenty normal infants (group I) and 51
      consecutive infants with echocardiography established isolated VSD (aged
      from 3months to 1year) were investigated. Among the 51 infants with VSD,
      28 with shunt fraction, Qp/Qs&lt; or =1.5 were free of congestive heart
      failure symptoms (group II); 23 with shunt fraction, Qp/Qs&gt; or =2.0 were
      in congestive heart failure (group IIIa); and 23 of these 23 infants had
      undergone VSD repair 6months before their second study (group IIIb). All
      insulin-like growth factors-II (IGF-II) and human growth hormone (h-GH),
      insulin like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and its specific
      serum protease-MMP9 concentration were analyzed using ELISA and
      zymography, respectively. RESULTS: Serum IGF-II and MMP9 exhibited
      significant decreasing trends among the three groups and significantly
      lower concentrations of IGF-II, IGF-II/IGFBP-3 ratio and MMP9, were found
      only in the severe group whereas h-GH/IGF-II ratio became significantly
      higher in this group. Moreover, there were no significant differences in
      these parameters between the infants after surgical correction and the
      normal ones. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in IGF-II and MMP9 serum
      concentration was identified in infants with VSD after surgical repair.
      These findings also indicate a significant relationship between IGF-II,
      MMP9 and VSD which might be used as diagnosis and prognosis indicators for
      this defect. Slight reductions in IGF-II/IGFBP3 ratio and slight increase
      in the h-GH/IGF-II ratio indicate mild VSD. The reductions in the MMP9,
      IGF-II, and IGF-II/IGFBP3 ratio plus high increase in the h-GH/IGF-II
      ratio indicate severe VSD.

TI  - Age and gender specific pediatric reference intervals for aldolase,
      amylase, ceruloplasmin, creatine kinase, pancreatic amylase, prealbumin,
      and uric acid.
PG  - 788-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reference intervals can vary based on age and gender. Proper
      partitioning is necessary to classify health status in different age
      groups. METHODS: Seven analytes; aldolase, amylase, ceruloplasmin,
      creatine kinase, pancreatic amylase, prealbumin and uric acid; were
      assayed on Roche Modular P analyzers using serum samples from 1765
      children (867 females and 898 males; age range, 6months to 17y). Subjects
      6months up to 7y were undergoing minor surgical procedures. Children 7 to
      17y were apparently healthy. Subjects with significant medical history or
      who were taking any medications were excluded. RESULTS: Separate reference
      intervals for boys and girls were required for 33% of the groups. Aldolase
      showed gender variation in the 6-8, 12-14, and 15-17y. Amylase was the
      only analyte that showed no significant gender differences within any age
      group. Both ceruloplasmin and uric acid had significant differences
      between the 12-14 and 15-17y groups. Creatine kinase exhibited
      statistically significant gender differences in all age groups with the
      exception of 6-8y. CONCLUSION: We verified that when establishing
      pediatric reference intervals, partitioning by age and gender is
      frequently necessary.

TI  - Effect of the omega-acylceramides on the lipid organization of stratum
      corneum model membranes evaluated by X-ray diffraction and FTIR studies
      (Part I).
AB  - The lipid organization in the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum
      corneum, is important for the skin barrier function. The stratum corneum
      lipids are composed of ceramides (CER), free fatty acids (FFA) and
      cholesterol (CHOL). In the present study Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
      and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques were utilized to
      evaluate the effect of three C18 fatty acid esterified omega-acylceramides
      (CER EOS) on the lipid organization of stratum corneum model membranes.
      FTIR spectra (scissoring and rocking bands) showed as a function of
      temperature significant line-shape changes for both components assigned to
      the orthorhombic phase. Second-derivative analyzes revealed a significant
      decrease in the interchain coupling strength (Deltanu values) for the
      samples formed by CER EOS with the linoleate (CER EOS-L) and oleate (CER
      EOS-O) moiety around 28.5 degrees C. However, only a gradual decrease in
      the Deltanu values was noticed for the mixture formed with CER EOS with
      the stearate moiety (CER EOS-S) over the whole temperature range. In the
      absence of CER EOS the decrease started already at 25.5 degrees C,
      demonstrating that CER EOS stabilized the orthorhombic lattice. This
      stabilization was most pronounced for the CER EOS-S. Spectral fittings
      allowed to evaluate the orientation changes of the skeletal plane within
      the orthorhombic unit cell (theta values) for a given temperature range.
      From the best-fit parameters (peak area values), a decrease in the
      orthorhombic phase contribution to the scissoring band was also monitored
      as a function of the temperature. SAXS studies showed the coexistence of
      two lamellar phases with a periodicity of  approximately 5.5nm (short
      periodicity phase, SPP) and  approximately 12nm (LPP) in the presence of
      the CER EOS-L and CER EOS-O. However, no diffraction peaks associated to
      the LPP were detected for CER EOS-S. While CER EOS-S most efficiently
      stabilized the orthorhombic phase, CER EOS-L and CER EOS-O promoted the
      presence of the LPP. Therefore, the presence of all three CER EOS as
      observed in human stratum corneum may contribute to a proper skin barrier
      function.

TI  - Crystal structure of bacterial cell-surface alginate-binding protein with
      an M75 peptidase motif.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - A gram-negative Sphingomonas sp. A1 directly incorporates alginate
      polysaccharide into the cytoplasm via the cell-surface pit and ABC
      transporter. A cell-surface alginate-binding protein, Algp7, functions as
      a concentrator of the polysaccharide in the pit. Based on the primary
      structure and genetic organization in the bacterial genome, Algp7 was
      found to be homologous to an M75 peptidase motif-containing EfeO, a
      component of a ferrous ion transporter. Despite the presence of an M75
      peptidase motif with high similarity, the Algp7 protein purified from
      recombinant Escherichia coli cells was inert on insulin B chain and
      N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-p-nitroanilide, both of which are substrates for a
      typical M75 peptidase, imelysin, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The X-ray
      crystallographic structure of Algp7 was determined at 2.10A resolution by
      single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. Although a metal-binding motif,
      HxxE, conserved in zinc ion-dependent M75 peptidases is also found in
      Algp7, the crystal structure of Algp7 contains no metal even at the motif.
      The protein consists of two structurally similar up-and-down helical
      bundles as the basic scaffold. A deep cleft between the bundles is
      sufficiently large to accommodate macromolecules such as alginate
      polysaccharide. This is the first structural report on a bacterial
      cell-surface alginate-binding protein with an M75 peptidase motif.

TI  - Identification and characterization of new long chain Acyl-CoA
      dehydrogenases.
AB  - Long-chain fatty acids are an important source of energy in muscle and
      heart where the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) participate in consecutive
      cycles of beta-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA and reducing equivalents
      for generating energy. However, the role of long-chain fatty acid
      oxidation in the brain and other tissues that do not rely on fat for
      energy is poorly understood. Here we characterize two new ACADs, ACAD10
      and ACAD11, both with significant expression in human brain. ACAD11
      utilizes substrates with primary carbon chain lengths between 20 and 26,
      with optimal activity towards C22CoA. The combination of ACAD11 with the
      newly characterized ACAD9 accommodates the full spectrum of long chain
      fatty acid substrates presented to mitochondrial beta-oxidation in human
      cerebellum. ACAD10 has significant activity towards the branched-chain
      substrates R and S, 2 methyl-C15-CoA and is highly expressed in fetal but
      not adult brain. This pattern of expression is similar to that of LCAD,
      another ACAD previously shown to be involved in long branched chain fatty
      acid metabolism. Interestingly, the ACADs in human cerebellum were found
      to have restricted cellular distribution. ACAD9 was most highly expressed
      in the granular layer, ACAD11 in the white matter, and MCAD in the
      molecular layer and axons of specific neurons. This compartmentalization
      of ACADs in the human central nerve system suggests that beta-oxidation in
      cerebellum participates in different functions other than generating
      energy, for example, the synthesis and/or degradation of unique cellular
      lipids and catabolism of aromatic amino acids, compounds that are vital to
      neuronal function.

TI  - Chronic supplementation of beta-hydroxy-beta methylbutyrate (HMbeta)
      increases the activity of the GH/IGF-I axis and induces hyperinsulinemia
      in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMbeta) is a metabolite of
      leucine widely used for improving sports performance. Although HMbeta is
      recognized to promote anabolic or anti-catabolic effects on protein
      metabolism, the impact of its long-term use on skeletal muscle and/or
      genes that control the skeletal protein balance is not fully known. This
      study aimed to investigate whether chronic HMbeta treatment affects the
      activity of GH/IGF-I axis and skeletal muscle IGF-I and myostatin mRNA
      expression. DESIGN: Rats were treated with HMbeta (320mg/kg BW) or
      vehicle, by gavage, for 4weeks, and killed by decapitation. Blood was
      collected for evaluation of serum insulin, glucose and IGF-I
      concentrations. Samples of pituitary, liver, extensor digitorum longus
      (EDL) and soleus muscles were collected for total RNA or protein
      extraction to evaluate the expression of pituitary growth hormone (GH)
      gene (mRNA and protein), hepatic insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
      mRNA, skeletal muscle IGF-I and myostatin mRNA by Northern blotting/real
      time-PCR, or Western blotting. RESULTS: Chronic HMbeta treatment increased
      the content of pituitary GH mRNA and GH, hepatic IGF-I mRNA and serum
      IGF-I concentration. No changes were detected on skeletal muscle IGF-I and
      myostatin mRNA expression. However, the HMbeta-treated rats although
      normoglycemic, exhibited hyperinsulinemia. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented
      herein extend the body of evidence on the potential role of
      HMbeta-treatment in stimulating GH/IGF-I axis activity. In spite of this
      effect, HMbeta supplementation also induces an apparent insulin resistance
      state which might limit the beneficial aspects of the former results, at
      least in rats under normal nutritional status and health conditions.

TI  - The Possibility of Differentiation between Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis
      and Fatty Liver in Rabbits on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced Open-type MRI Scans.
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We used rabbits to investigate the possibility
      of differentiating between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fatty
      liver (FL) on scans acquired by open-type and
      gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid
      (Gd-EOB-DTPA)enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We divided 15 adult rabbits into three equal groups; they
      received standard (control group), high-fat (FL) content (FL group), or
      choline-deficient chow (NASH group). With the animals under general
      anesthesia we acquired scans on an open 0.3-Tesla MRI system. Signal
      intensity (SI) was measured before and after contrast administration and
      defined as SI-pre and SI-post, respectively. Relative SI enhancement (Sr)
      was calculated using the equation: Sr = (average of three SI-post- minus
      average of three SI values in no-signal fields)/(average of three SI-pre-
      minus average of three SI values in no-signal fields) x 100. Maximum Sr
      (Srmax), the time (in seconds) required to reach Srmax (Tmax), and the
      difference between Srmax and Sr at 30 minutes (Sr(30m)R) were analyzed.
      RESULTS: Srmax was significantly higher in the NASH rabbits than the other
      two groups (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: In rabbits, the Srmax value made it
      possible to differentiate NASH from normal and fatty liver.

TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Characterization of the Acute Changes in
      Myocardial Structure and Function after Distal Coronary Microembolization
      Using MDCT.
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential of multidetector
      computed tomography (MDCT) in assessing, at 72 hours, the effects of
      distal coronary microembolization on myocardial structure and function.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microembolic material (total volume=16 mm(3) of
      40-120 mum diameter) was selectively delivered in the left anterior
      descending coronary artery under x-ray fluoroscopy (n = 6 pigs). After 72
      hours, 64-slice MDCT was used to assess LV function, perfusion, and
      viability. For comparison between the measurements at 80 kV, 120 kV, and
      postmortem we used Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation. Histochemical and
      histopathological staining was used for quantitative and qualitative
      characterization of microinfarct. RESULTS: Cine MDCT showed the
      deleterious effects of microembolization on systolic wall thickening, LV
      volumes, and ejection fraction. Perfusion parameters, such as max upslope,
      peak attenuation, and time to peak, differed between microinfarct
      territory and remote myocardium. Inconsistency in visualizing microinfarct
      was observed using tube voltages of 80 kV and 120 kV. The extent of
      heterogeneous microinfarct was 4.5 +/- 1.0 % of LV mass at 80 kV, 6.1 +/-
      0.9% LV at 120 kV, and 5.9 +/- 1.1% LV on postmortem. There was
      significant difference in the extent of microinfarct measured on 80 kV
      MDCT compared with 120 kV and postmortem. Microscopic examination revealed
      the random distribution of obstructed microvessels surrounded by
      myocardial necrosis and inflammatory cells in all animals. CONCLUSION:
      Both visible and nonvisible microinfarct cause perfusion deficit and LV
      dysfunction. MDCT is sensitive for quantifying early functional changes in
      LV caused by microembolization. Further improvement in spatial resolution
      of this technology is needed to improve visualization of microinfarct.

TI  - Increased levels of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in
      donor lungs rejected for transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytokine analysis of the donor lung shows significant promise
      as a strategy to biologically evaluate the organ before transplantation.
      This study compared gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines
      between clinically rejected and transplanted donor lungs. METHODS: Lung
      tissue biopsy specimens were taken from 17 clinically unsuitable lungs and
      24 transplanted donor lungs before cold flush perfusion preservation.
      Expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma,
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-1beta messenger (m)RNA were
      measured in a blinded fashion by quantitative real-time reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction. Prospectively collected clinical
      data were analyzed retrospectively and compared with cytokine expression
      results. The primary end point was to examine the difference of expression
      levels of these cytokines between rejected donor lungs and lungs used for
      transplantation. RESULTS: The ratio of partial pressure of oxygen/fraction
      of inspired oxygen, time on ventilation, infiltrates on chest X-ray
      images, and abnormal bronchoscopic findings for donors were statistically
      different between rejected and transplanted donor lungs. Comparison of
      gene expression levels showed that clinically rejected lungs had
      significantly higher levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha than the lungs used
      for transplantation. Hierarchic clustering with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha
      showed that 4 clinically unsuitable donor lungs had very low levels of
      these 2 cytokines. CONCLUSION: Levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha are
      significantly higher in donor lungs rejected for transplantation using
      clinical criteria. However, a sub-set of non-used lungs had low levels of
      IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and thus could potentially have been used for
      transplantation. In the near future, these markers could be used to assist
      in the lung donor selection process and to monitor organ reparative
      strategies.

TI  - Posterior interbody fusion using a diagonal cage with unilateral
      transpedicular screw fixation for lumbar stenosis.
PG  - 324-8
AB  - Few reports have described the combined use of unilateral pedicle screw
      fixation and interbody fusion for lumbar stenosis. We retrospectively
      reviewed 79 patients with lumbar stenosis. The rationale and effectiveness
      of unilateral pedicle screw fixation were studied from biomechanical and
      clinical perspectives, aiming to reduce stiffness of the implant. All
      patients were operated with posterior interbody fusion using a diagonal
      cage in combination with unilateral transpedicular screw fixation and had
      reached the 3-year follow-up interval after operation. The mean operating
      time was 115 minutes (range=95-150 min) and the mean estimated blood loss
      was 150mL (range=100-200mL). The mean duration of hospital stay was 10
      days (range=7-15 days). Clinical outcomes were assessed prior to surgery
      and reassessed at intervals using Denis' pain and work scales. Fusion
      status was determined from X-rays and CT scans. At the final follow-up,
      the clinical results were satisfactory and patients showed significantly
      improved scores (p&lt;0.01) either on the pain or the work scale. Successful
      fusion was achieved in all patients. There were no new postoperative
      radiculopathies, or instances of malpositioned or fractured hardware.
      Posterior interbody fusion using a diagonal cage with unilateral
      transpedicular fixation is an effective treatment for decompressive
      surgery for lumbar stenosis.

TI  - Breast cancer in lupus.
AB  - The purpose was to evaluate the frequency of breast cancer (BC) in
      patients with either systemic (SLE) or incomplete lupus erythematosus
      (ILE), and possibly to find out immunological differences in patients with
      and without cancer. 133 consecutive female patients with lupus were
      included. The records were retrospectively analysed with respect to both
      malignant disease and routine laboratory parameters (e.g. autoantibodies,
      white blood cell counts). BC was the most common malignancy that was
      detected in 50% of female lupus patients with concomitant oncological
      disease. Other malignancies were significantly less (p &lt; 0.001) frequent.
      Only ILE-patients had BC or other oncological diseases. The proportion of
      ILE-patients with SSA- and SSB-autoantibodies was significantly higher (p
      &lt; 1.5 x 10(-10) and 9.1 x 10(-17)) in those with malignancies than
      without. The presented data suggest that BC is the most common malignancy
      in patients with ILE. SLE is no prerequisite to acquire an oncological
      disease. Immunological disturbances (e.g. SSA- and SSB-autoantibodies)
      could play a role in the oncogensis.

TI  - Real-time QCM-D monitoring of cellular responses to different cytomorphic
      agents.
PG  - 3207-12
AB  - Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is used
      for real-time in situ detection of cytoskeletal changes in live primary
      endothelial cells in response to different cytomorphic agents; namely, the
      surfactant Triton-X 100 (TX-100) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
      Reproducible dissipation versus frequency (Df) plots provide unique
      signatures of the interactions between endothelial cells and cytomorphic
      agents. While the QCM-D response for TX-100 can be described in two steps
      (changes in the osmotic pressure of the medium prior to observing the
      expected cell lysis), LPS results in a different single-phase signal. A
      complementary analysis is carried out to evaluate the possible competitive
      effects of TX-100 and LPS through the QCM-D response to BAEC stress by
      analyzing the Df plots obtained. Experiments with non-toxic components
      (fibronectin or serum) produce a different QCM-D response than that
      observed for the toxic chemicals, suggesting the use of Df plot signatures
      for the possible differentiation between cytotoxic or non-cytotoxic
      effects. Observations obtained by QCM-D signals are confirmed by
      conducting fluorescence microscopy at the same time. Our results show that
      a fast (few minutes) sensing response can be obtained in situ and in
      real-time. The conclusions from this study suggest that QCM-D can
      potentially be used in biodetection for applications in drug screening
      tests and diagnosis.

TI  - Real-Time in vivo Dosimetry with MOSFET Detectors in Serial Tomotherapy
      for Head and Neck Cancer Patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: A real-time dose verification method using a recently designed
      metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) dosimetry
      system was evaluated for quality assurance (QA) of intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Following the
      investigation of key parameters that might affect the accuracy of MOSFET
      measurements (i.e., source surface distance [SSD], field size, beam
      incident angles and radiation energy spectrum), the feasibility of this
      detector in IMRT dose verification was demonstrated by comparison with ion
      chamber measurements taken in an IMRT QA phantom. Real-time in vivo
      measurements were also performed with the MOSFET system during serial
      tomotherapy treatments administered to 8 head and neck cancer patients .
      RESULTS: MOSFET sensitivity did not change with SSD. For field sizes
      smaller than 20 x 20 cm(2), MOFET sensitivity varied within 1.0%. The
      detector angular response was isotropic within 2% over 360 degrees , and
      the observed sensitivity variation due to changes in the energy spectrum
      was negligible in 6-MV photons. MOSFET system measurements and ion chamber
      measurements agreed at all points in IMRT phantom plan verification,
      within 5%. The mean difference between 48 IMRT MOSFET-measured doses and
      calculated values in 8 patients was 3.33% and ranged from -2.20% to 7.89%.
      More than 90% of the total measurements had deviations of less than 5%
      from the planned doses. CONCLUSION: The MOSFET dosimetry system has been
      proven to be an effective tool in evaluating the actual dose within
      individual patients during IMRT treatment.

TI  - Regulation of L-selectin expression by trauma-relevant cytokines.
AB  - The leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin is important for the rolling of
      neutrophil granulocytes (PMN), the first step of the cascade leading to
      adhesion, diapedesis, and subsequent organ dysfunction. The activation of
      leukocytes in the posttraumatic course is assumed to be induced by
      different pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the present study, we
      investigated the effects of stimulation with pro- and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines on the L-selectin surface expression on PMN. Twenty patients
      admitted to our institution for elective operations of the lower
      extremities were enrolled in a prospective clinical study. For the
      measurement of L-selectin expression, blood was taken before the operation
      (0h), as well as 24h and 48h postoperatively. Without and after incubation
      with different pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta,
      IL-6 and IL-10), the surface expression of L-selectin was detected using
      an anti-L-selectin-specific antibody and flow cytometry. L-selectin
      surface expression without any stimulation showed a non-significant
      increase 48h after the operation (63.6+/-6.6ng/ml at 0h, 95.2+/-10.5ng/ml
      at 48h). Stimulation with TNF-alpha resulted in a significant decrease of
      L-selectin expression at 0h (25.6+/-2.7ng/ml; p&lt;0.05) and 24h
      (18.3+/-2.5ng/ml; p&lt;0.05), but not at 48h (39.8+/-4.2ng/ml). No
      significant differences were observed after stimulation with IL-1beta,
      IL-6, and IL-10 in comparison to the non-stimulated group. The study
      results indicate that the primary pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha
      regulates the L-selectin surface expression on PMN after surgical trauma.
      Therefore, a regulation of neutrophil activation on this level might be
      crucial in the development of posttraumatic complications.

TI  - Characteristics and consequences of heroin use among older adults in the
      United States: A review of the literature, treatment implications, and
      recommendations for further research.
PG  - 279-85
AB  - This review reports on the results of a comprehensive literature search of
      studies examining the physical and mental health characteristics of older
      adults in the United States who use heroin. Multiple databases were
      searched for papers meeting the inclusion criteria of heroin users who
      were age 50years or older. A total of 14 articles covering 9 different
      studies met the review inclusion criteria. All of the studies were
      convenience samples, and seven of the nine studies (77.8%) were entirely
      drawn from substance abuse treatment programs, primarily methadone
      maintenance programs. Findings from the qualitative studies suggest that
      the marginalization of older heroin users was a predominant experience
      that impacted the intent to seek treatment as well as treatment retention.
      While articles reported high levels of physical and
      psychological/psychiatric comorbidities with substance misuse, research on
      heroin use and methadone treatment among older adults is scant and the
      quantitative findings are inconsistent. The articles reviewed in this
      study demonstrate that the needs of this population will be significant,
      yet the development of appropriate interventions and treatment for older
      adult heroin users will be contingent on empirical research that
      adequately describes mental and physical health problems.

TI  - Heavy metal source analysis in municipal solid waste (MSW): Case study on
      Cu and Zn.
PG  - 1082-7
AB  - This research contributes to the knowledge of the heavy metal sources in
      municipal solid waste (MSW). Samples were collected from 8 cities of
      Zhejiang province, Eastern China. Cu and Zn, the most two conventional
      heavy metals with extensive distribution in many kinds of MSW components,
      were investigated. It shows components of kitchen waste (KW), ash (AS),
      plastic (PL), and paper (PA) have high universality in MSW and accounted
      for 55.1-95.5% in each MSW sample. Moreover, these four components are
      also the main heavy metal sources of MSW, which accounted for 76.3% and
      82.3% contribution of the Cu and Zn contents, respectively. The Cu and Zn
      contents in the gross MSW sample were 41.2-1643.7mgkg(-1) and
      109.3-1077.9mgkg(-1), respectively, which on different degree exceed the
      set standard for &quot;environmental quality standard for soil&quot; (Cu,
      100mgkg(-1); Zn, 400mgkg(-1)) of China and have high potential of
      environmental risk. The heavy metal contents in the gross MSW do not have
      spatial variation but present high seasonal variation, significantly
      higher in summer than winter (P&lt;0.01). Much more attention should be paid
      on the MSW management in summer to avoid heavy metal pollution.

TI  - Enhanced differentiation and clonogenicity of human endometrial polyp stem
      cells.
AB  - Endometrial polyps arise from endometrial overgrowth and may cause
      intermenstrual bleeding, irregular bleeding, and menorrhagia. In this
      study, endometrial polyps were harvested from hysterectomized specimens
      from 6 female patients not on hormone therapy. Endometrial polyp
      mesenchymal stem cells (EPMSCs) were isolated and characterized. Selected
      cells were spindle-shaped, and expressed surface markers CD90 and CD146.
      The EPMSCs proliferated actively in vitro. A colony-forming study
      demonstrates that EPMSCs had a colony-generating capacity. When cultured
      in a defined medium, EPMSCs can differentiate to osteoblast-, adipocyte-,
      and neuron-like cells. No telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
      expression was noted. Experimental results demonstrate that EPMSCs are a
      population of mesenchymal progenitor cells existing in human endometrial
      polyps that are capable of proliferation, differentiation, and
      colonogenicity exceeding that of bone marrow stem cells and endometrial
      stromal cells. These EPMSCs may be an alternative resource of adult stem
      cells for future regenerative therapy.

TI  - FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells: control of FOXP3 expression by
      pharmacological agents.
AB  - Naturally arising CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), which
      specifically express the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP3, are
      essential for the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune
      homeostasis. Tregs can suppress the activation, proliferation and effector
      function of other lymphocytes in physiological and pathological immune
      responses. Therefore, control of the development, survival, and function
      of Tregs is instrumental for effective control of immune responses. For
      example, cytokines such as interleukin-2 and transforming growth
      factor-beta, monoclonal antibodies to the Treg-associated molecules such
      as interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain and cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte-associated 4, and pharmacological agents that alter signaling
      pathways for Treg function, can augment or dampen the suppressive activity
      of Tregs. How these agents control the function of Tregs at the molecular
      level remains to be elucidated. However, it is envisaged that
      pharmacological control of the function and development of Tregs by
      targeting FOXP3 or Treg-associated molecules will enable better control of
      immune responses in various clinical settings.

TI  - Effect of identification and intervention age on language development for
      mandarin-speaking deaf children with high family involvement.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess the language ability
      between early-intervention and later-intervention Mandarin-speaking deaf
      children, who have normal cognition and high family involvement. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: There are 29 subjects enrolled. 11 born deaf children
      received early intervention (7 HA and 4 CI) before 6 months old as study
      group. Another 18 born deaf children received later intervention (11 HA
      and 7 CI) between 7 and 35 months old as reference group. They were all
      regarded as with normal cognition and high family involvement. Their mean
      assessment age was 50 months old in early group and 51 months old in later
      group. We used several tools to test their perceptive vocabulary size, to
      evaluate perceptive language syntax and to compare perceptive and
      expressive language scores. RESULTS: Our study revealed there are
      significant difference between these two groups in the ability of
      vocabulary size, perceptive language syntax and perceptive language
      scores. The results showed there is no significant difference between
      these two groups in their expressive language scores, although their
      achievement score is higher in the early group. CONCLUSIONS: It clearly
      showed the ability of perceptive language in early-intervention deaf
      children was better than that of later-intervention. The ability of their
      expressive language showed no difference between them.

TI  - Transient or persistent norovirus infection does not alter the pathology
      of Salmonella typhimurium induced intestinal inflammation and fibrosis in
      mice.
AB  - Murine noroviruses (MNV) are currently the most prevalent viruses
      infecting mouse research colonies. Concurrent infection of research mice
      with these viruses can dramatically alter the experimental outcome in some
      research models, but not others. In this report, we investigated the
      effect of MNV1 and MNV4 on a murine model of intestinal inflammation and
      fibrosis induced by Salmonella typhimurium infection in C57BL/6 mice.
      Subsequent co-infection of these mice with MNV1 or MNV4 did not lead to
      major changes in histopathology, the inflammatory response, or the
      fibrotic response. Thus, MNV does not substantially alter all
      gastrointestinal research models, highlighting the importance of
      investigating potential alterations in the research outcome by MNV on an
      individual basis. We hypothesize that this is particularly important in
      cases of research models that use immunocompromised mice, which could be
      more sensitive to MNV infection-induced changes.

TI  - Autofluorescence imaging can identify preinvasive or clinically occult
      lesions in fallopian tube epithelium: A promising step towards screening
      and early detection.
PG  - 385-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optical imaging systems are robust, portable, relatively
      inexpensive, and have proven utility in detecting precancerous lesions in
      the lung, esophagus, colon, oral cavity and cervix. We describe the use of
      light-induced endogenous fluorescence (autofluorescence) in identifying
      preinvasive and occult carcinomas in ex vivo samples of human fallopian
      tube (FT) epithelium. METHODS: Women undergoing surgery for an i) ovarian
      mass, ii) a history suggestive of hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, or
      iii) known serous ovarian cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)
      were approached for informed consent. Immediately following surgery, FT's
      were photographed in reflectance and fluorescence at high resolution.
      Images included: (1) white-light reflectance of luminal/epithelial
      surface; (2) narrow-band green reflectance (570nm) (3) green
      autofluorescence (405/436nm excitation); and (4) blue autofluorescence
      (405nm excitation). Areas revealing a loss of natural tissue fluorescence
      or marked increase in tissue microvasculature were recorded and compared
      to final histopathologic diagnosis (SEE-FIM protocol). RESULTS: Fifty-six
      cases involving one or both fallopian tubes underwent reflectance and
      fluorescence visualization. Nine cases were excluded, either secondary to
      non-ovarian primary pathology (7) or excessive trauma (2) rendering tissue
      interpretation impossible. Of the 47 cases remaining, there were 11 high
      grade serous (HGS) and 9 non-serous ovarian carcinomas undergoing primary
      debulking surgery, 5 serous carcinomas having received NAC, 8 benign
      ovarian tumors, and 14 women undergoing risk-reducing bilateral
      salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO). Methodology was feasible, efficient, and
      reproducible. TIC or carcinoma was identified in 7/11 HGS, 3/5 NAC, and
      1/14 RRBSO. Optical images were reviewed to determine test positive or
      negative based on standardized criteria. Sensitivity, specificity,
      positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were
      calculated for the entire cohort (73%; 83%; 57%; 91%) and in a subgroup
      that excluded non-serous histology (87.5%; 92%; 78%; 96%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Abnormal FT lesions can be identified using ex vivo optical imaging
      technologies. With this platform, we will move towards genomic
      interrogation of identified lesions, and developing in vivo screening
      modalities via falloposcopy.

TI  - Markers of fibrinolysis as predictors for maintenance of sinus rhythm
      after electrical cardioversion.
PG  - 189-92
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and metabolic pathways
      provide possible links between the inflammatory and hypofibrinolytic
      states in atrial fibrillation. Our aim was to explore the role of mass
      concentrations of PAI-1 and tPA, activities of PAI-1 and tPA as predictors
      of recurrence of atrial fibrillation adjusted for CRP. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The study included 129 patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation. Laboratory analyses were performed including PAI-1 activity,
      PAI-1 mass, tPA activity, tPA mass and CRP in baseline. Patients were then
      randomized to atorvastatin (40mg, two tablets once daily) or placebo,
      initiated at least 14days before the elective cardioversion. Further
      samples and follow-up were made at day 2 and 30days after cardioversion.
      RESULTS: In univariate logistic regression no fibrinolytic variable was
      significantly correlated with rhythm in day 30. In multivariate analysis
      lower PAI-1 mass was significantly associated with sinus rhythm in all
      models including fibrinolytic variables, CRP, metabolic components, age,
      hypertension and smoking. After adding treatment allocation to the fully
      adjusted model, PAI-1 mass remained significantly associated with sinus
      rhythm both at day 2 and 30 (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.95-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: No
      fibrinolytic component alone was found to be a predictor of recurrence of
      atrial fibrillation. In multivariate models lower PAI-1 mass was
      associated with sinus rhythm even after adjusting for CRP, markers of the
      metabolic syndrome and treatment with atorvastatin. Our findings suggest a
      patophysiological link between AF and PAI-1 mass but the relation to
      inflammation remains unclear.

TI  - Lack of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 protects mice from thrombosis
      after collagen/epinephrine challenge.
PG  - 228-234
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In thrombotic processes, during the association of
      leukocytes with platelets and endothelial cells, P-selectin glycoprotein
      ligand-1 (PSGL-1) binds to P-selectin, expressedon activated platelets and
      endothelial cells. Our aim was to establish the role of PSGL-1 in thrombus
      formation by evaluating the response to thrombotic stimuli in wild type
      and PSGL-1 knockout mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were challenged by
      tail vein injection of (i) 15mug collagen plus 3mug epinephrine (coll/epi)
      (ii) 7.5mug collagen plus 1.5mug epinephrine or (iii) saline.
      Retro-orbital blood samples were collected in ACD anticoagulaed tubes and
      platelet and leukocyte counts were measured. In addition, kidneys, liver,
      spleen and lungs were investigated for fibrin deposition by
      immunohistochemistry and Western-blotting. Frozen sections were analysed
      for double labeling for platelet and leukocyte presence. RESULTS: After
      coll/epi challenge, the number of platelets and leukocytes decreased
      significantly in both genotypes. Lower agonist concentration resulted in
      an attenuated platelet decrease in PSGL-1 knockout mice compared to the
      controls, however changes in leukocyte and neutrophil counts were not
      significantly different in the two strains. In knockout mice considerably
      less fibrin deposition has been observedin the lungs by Western-blotting
      and immunohistochemistry. After coll/epi challenge the lungs of the PSGL-1
      knockout animals contained both platelets and leukocytes but less thrombi
      has been detected than in wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      indicate that the deficiency of PSGL-1 results in milder thrombocytopenia,
      less fibrin deposition and lower number of thrombosed blood vessels,
      suggesting that this molecule is essential for multicellular interactions
      during thrombus formation.

TI  - Relationship of aquaporin 1, 3, and 5 expression in lung cancer cells to
      cellular differentiation, invasive growth, and metastasis potential.
AB  - An oncogenic capacity of aquaporins, transmembrane channels for water, was
      recently proposed. This study seeks to elucidate the involvement of
      aquaporin 1, 3, and 5 in the development and progression of lung cancer.
      Expression of aquaporin 1, 3, and 5 was examined by immunohistochemistry,
      Western blot, and laser-captured microdissection/real-time reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction in 160 lung cancers of various
      histologic subtypes; and its correlation with clinicopathological factors
      and survival was analyzed. Aquaporin 1, 3, and 5 were expressed in tumor
      cells in 71%, 40%, and 56% of lung cancers, respectively. Aquaporin
      expressions were frequent in adenocarcinomas, whereas aquaporin 1 and 5
      were negative in squamous cell carcinomas. Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma
      cells exhibited an apicolateral aquaporin 1 and apicolateral or
      basolateral aquaporin 3 localization in nonmucinous type, and apical
      aquaporin 1 and 5 and basolateral aquaporin 3 expression in mucinous type,
      which corresponded to aquaporins expression of nonneoplastic lung tissue.
      Basolateral aquaporin 5 expression was acquired during tumorigenesis of
      nonmucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. In contrast, invasive
      adenocarcinoma tumor cells overexpressed aquaporin 1 and 5 with loss of
      subcellular polarization and with an intracytoplasmic distribution.
      Overexpression of aquaporin 1 correlated with high postoperative
      adenocarcinoma metastasis ratios and unfavorable disease-free survival
      rates (P = .031). We conclude that expression patterns of aquaporin 1, 3,
      and 5 in lung cancer cells are mostly associated with cellular
      differentiation. However, the expression of aquaporin 1 and 5 is
      up-regulated in invading lung cancer cells, particularly in
      adenocarcinomas; and the overexpression of aquaporin 1 with loss of
      subcellular polarization is suggested to be involved in their invasive and
      metastatic potential.

TI  - Expression of podoplanin in thymoma: its correlation with tumor invasion,
      nodal metastasis, and poor clinical outcome.
AB  - Recent studies have shown that podoplanin overexpression is associated
      with lymph node metastasis and poor clinical outcome in several malignant
      tumors. To investigate the role of podoplanin in thymoma, we examined 111
      thymomas by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody D2-40, which
      recognizes podoplanin. The tumors consisted of 8 type A, 40 type AB, 15
      type B1, 23 type B2, 15 type B3, and 10 combined thymomas according to the
      World Health Organization histological classification system and of 41
      stage I, 28 stage II, 16 stage III, 20 stage IVa, and 6 stage IVb thymomas
      according to the Masaoka staging system. We have found podoplanin
      expression in 0 (0%) type A, 4 (10%) type AB, 4 (27%) type B1, 16 (70%)
      type B2, 10 (67%) type B3, and 7 (70%) combined thymomas and in 5 (12%)
      cases of stage I, 7 (25%) of stage II, 11 (69%) of stage III, 12 (60%) of
      stage IVa, and all (100%) of stage IVb thymomas. Podoplanin was
      significantly expressed in B2/B3/combined thymomas and advanced stage
      thymomas (P &lt; .0001). On survival analysis, podoplanin expression was
      significantly associated with an increased risk of death for the whole
      group of thymomas (P = .0002), although it was not identified as an
      independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. The significant
      survival curve differences of podoplanin expression were also seen for
      stage III/IVa/IVb thymomas (P = .0409) and B2/B3/combined thymomas (P =
      .0478). In conclusion, D2-40 immunostaining seems to be valuable for
      predicting the aggressive and metastatic potential of thymomas and the
      prognosis of the patients.

TI  - A case of secondary malignant giant-cell tumor of bone with p53 mutation
      after long-term follow-up.
AB  - A 46-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a recurrent giant-cell
      tumor of the distal femur. This was his fourth recurrence, and it had
      occurred 16 years after his last treatment. The resected recurrent tumor
      was histologically determined to be a conventional giant-cell tumor.
      However, a single lung metastatic lesion and local recurrence were noticed
      6 months after the resection, both of which were surgically excised. The
      lung lesion was histologically determined to be an implantation of
      giant-cell tumor, whereas the local recurrent lesion contained a clearly
      separated fibrosarcomatous area within the conventional giant-cell tumor.
      Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse and strong p53 expression in the
      fibrosarcomatous area. Direct sequencing revealed a p53 mutation in the
      sarcomatous area and a recessive mutant signal in the conventional area.
      The lung lesion also contained the same p53 mutation. Identification of
      the p53 mutation may help in diagnosing potential malignant transformation
      of giant-cell tumor.

TI  - Active matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity discriminates colonic mucosa,
      adenomas with and without high-grade dysplasia, and cancers.
AB  - Pathologic assessment of colorectal adenomas, a complex task with
      significant interobserver variability, typically defines the scheduling of
      surveillance colonoscopies after removal of adenomas. We have
      characterized the activity levels of pro-matrix metalloproteinase-2,
      active matrix metalloproteinase-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in
      colorectal adenomas and carcinomas as potential markers of pathologic
      progression during colorectal tumorigenesis. Endogenous fully activated
      matrix metalloproteinase-2, in particular, has been studied less
      frequently in adenomas due to difficulties in detection. For this report,
      tissues (n = 119) from 51 individuals were extracted and assayed on
      gelatin zymograms with digital standardization to nanogram quantities of
      purified active controls. Resulting data were assessed by graphical and
      multinomial logit regression analyses to test whether matrix
      metalloproteinase-2 or matrix metalloproteinase-9 activities could
      discriminate among 4 different types of colorectal tissue (normal mucosa,
      adenomas with or without high-grade dysplasia, and invasive carcinomas).
      Active matrix metalloproteinase-2 successfully discriminated among these
      tissue categories. Median activity for active matrix metalloproteinase-2
      increased in a stepwise fashion with pathologic progression from normal
      mucosa to adenoma without high-grade dysplasia to adenoma with high-grade
      dysplasia to cancer. Although pro-matrix metalloproteinase-2 and
      pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 activities could discriminate to some
      extent among tissue categories, those effects did not contribute
      additional information. Active matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity
      correlated significantly with histopathologic assessment of colorectal
      tissues. The ability of active matrix metalloproteinase-2 to distinguish
      adenomas with high-grade dysplasia from adenomas without high-grade
      dysplasia may be particularly useful in predicting future colorectal
      cancer risk for an individual, thus optimizing scheduling of surveillance
      colonoscopies.

TI  - Erythroblastic sarcoma presenting as bilateral ovarian masses in an infant
      with pure erythroid leukemia.
AB  - Pure erythroid leukemia is a rare subtype of acute erythroid leukemia that
      is characterized by a predominant erythroid population, and erythroblastic
      sarcoma has not yet been described in the English literature. Here, we
      report a first case of erythroblastic sarcoma that presented as bilateral
      ovarian masses in a 3 (1/2)-month-old infant girl with pure erythroid
      leukemia. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed that the marrow was
      completely replaced by large-sized blasts consistent with erythroblasts.
      Immunophenotypically, both the tumor cells from the ovarian mass and bone
      marrow blasts were positive for CD117, glycophorin A, and hemoglobin A,
      demonstrating erythroid differentiation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase
      chain reaction showed that the tumor cells from ovarian mass expressed
      hemoglobin F and alpha1 spectrin, confirming their erythroid lineage.
      Conventional karyotype of the bone marrow aspirates revealed
      del(6)(q23q25) and trisomy 7 in all 21 cells examined. Fluorescence in
      situ hybridization of the ovarian mass demonstrated loss of
      c-myeloblastosis viral oncogene (C-MYB) at 6q23 locus in 41% of the cells,
      and deletion of chromosome 7 and 7q in 37% and 66% of cells, respectively.
      Taken together, we showed, for the first time, that pure erythroid
      leukemia presented as a myeloid sarcoma in the form of ovarian masses.

      (FOXP3)+ regulatory T cells were evaluated as reported previously.
      Ninety-one patients were evaluated, with a median age at diagnosis of 58
      years and median survival of 11.6 years. PD-1-positive cells correlated
      with the number of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (P = .01). On multivariate
      analysis, independent poor prognostic factors were age 55 years or greater
      (hazard ratio, 2.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-5.73; P = .006), bulky
      disease (hazard ratio, 2.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-5.00; P = .04),
      CD68(+) extrafollicular lymphoma-associated macrophages greater than 16.8
      cells/high-power field (hazard ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval,
      1.14-4.06; P = .02), and PD-1-positive cells greater than 35.6
      cells/high-power field (hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval,
      1.09-3.60; P = .03). These factors allowed construction of a risk score
      defining 3 distinct prognostic groups with 10-year overall survival of
      85%, 60%, and 15%. PD-1-positive follicular helper T cells and CD68(+)
      extrafollicular lymphoma-associated macrophages appear to predict overall
      survival in follicular lymphoma, and our findings support strategies aimed
      at modulating their function in follicular lymphoma. Future studies,
      performed prospectively on uniformly treated patient cohorts, should be
      performed to validate these findings.

TI  - Can molecular markers stratify the diagnostic value of high-grade
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia?
AB  - The diagnostic performance of isolated high-grade prostatic
      intraepithelial neoplasia in prostatic biopsies has recently been
      questioned, and molecular analysis of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
      neoplasia has been proposed for improved prediction of prostate cancer.
      Here, we retrospectively studied the value of isolated high-grade
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and the immunohistochemical markers
      alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase, Bcl-2, annexin II, and Ki-67 for
      better risk stratification of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
      neoplasia in our local Swiss population. From an initial 165 diagnoses of
      isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, we refuted 61
      (37%) after consensus expert review. We used 30 reviewed high-grade
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia cases with simultaneous biopsy
      prostate cancer as positive controls. Rebiopsies were performed in 66
      patients with isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and
      the median time interval between initial and repeat biopsy was 3 months.
      Twenty (30%) of the rebiopsies were positive for prostate cancer, and 10
      (15%) showed persistent isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
      neoplasia. Another 2 (3%) of the 66 patients were diagnosed with prostate
      cancer in a second rebiopsy. Mean prostate-specific antigen serum levels
      did not significantly differ between the 22 patients with prostate cancer
      and the 44 without prostate cancer in rebiopsies, and the 30 positive
      control patients, respectively (median values, 8.1, 7.7, and 8.8 ng/mL).
      None of the immunohistochemical markers, including alpha-methylacyl
      coenzyme A racemase, Bcl-2, annexin II, and Ki-67, revealed a
      statistically significant association with the risk of prostate cancer in
      repeat biopsies. Taken together, the 33% risk of being diagnosed with
      prostate cancer after a diagnosis of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial
      neoplasia justifies rebiopsy, at least in our not systematically
      prostate-specific antigen-screened population. There is not enough
      evidence that immunohistochemical markers can reproducibly stratify the
      risk of prostate cancer after a diagnosis of isolated high-grade prostatic
      intraepithelial neoplasia.

TI  - Oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasms-a clinicopathologic study of 13 new
      cases emphasizing the importance of their recognition.
AB  - Oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasms (OANs) are a rare but important subtype
      of adrenal tumors with unique clinical and morphological features. We
      present 13 previously unpublished cases, of which 3 were classified as
      benign, 2 as having borderline malignant potential, and 8 as malignant
      according to the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia criteria. Seven tumors (54%) showed
      evidence of endocrine activity. All were composed of more than 90%
      oncocytes confirmed immunohistochemically using the antimitochondrial
      antibody mES-13 and ultrastructurally in 4 cases. Small oncocytes were a
      frequent finding that challenges the conventional notion of oncocytes as
      necessarily having abundant cytoplasm. Most cases were immunoreactive for
      vimentin, synaptophysin, inhibin-alpha, melan A, and calretinin, the
      latter being a novel finding in this group of neoplasms. Cytokeratin
      positivity with AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 was variable. The literature was
      comprehensively reviewed to identify all cases of OANs reported to date.
      Hormone production is not as uncommon as previously believed, occurring in
      30%. The Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia criteria were retrospectively applied to all
      published cases with sufficient information and were shown to effectively
      separate tumors according to their future risk of recurrence and survival
      using Kaplan-Meier survival curves (log-rank test, P &lt; .001 for both). The
      estimated overall median survival for malignant oncocytic neoplasms is 58
      months (95% confidence interval = 27.5-88.5 months), providing the first
      preliminary evidence that the prognosis of malignant OANs is likely to be
      more favorable than conventional adrenocortical carcinomas, in which the
      reported median survival is between 14 and 32 months.

TI  - Down-regulation of microRNAs of the miR-200 family and miR-205, and an
      altered expression of classic and desmosomal cadherins in spindle cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck-hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition.
AB  - MicroRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by
      posttranscriptional regulation of target genes. miR-200 family and miR-205
      have been shown experimentally to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition. As epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the postulated
      pathogenetic mechanism in spindle cell carcinoma, we analyzed the
      expression of these microRNAs in spindle cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck in comparison to conventional squamous cell carcinoma of similar
      location and stage. We also analyzed the expression of classic and
      desmosomal cadherins, which are believed to be important targets during
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Forty-five cases of spindle cell
      carcinoma and 45 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for microRNAs, and
      immunohistochemistry for classic cadherins (E- and N-cadherins) and
      desmosomal cadherins. We found a significant down-regulation of the
      miR-200 family and miR-205, loss of desmosomal cadherins, and an altered
      expression of classic cadherins in spindle cell carcinoma in comparison to
      squamous cell carcinoma. Down-regulation of the miR-200 family and miR-205
      strongly supports the postulated role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      in spindle cell carcinoma. These microRNAs act on transcription repressors
      that were also up-regulated in our cases of spindle cell carcinoma, both
      on mRNA and on protein levels. The result is not only an altered
      expression of classic cadherins in adherens junctions but also a complete
      loss of desmosomal cadherins.

TI  - Methylation status of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 promoter and
      its overexpression in colorectal cancer.
AB  - T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 has been implicated in tumor invasion
      and metastasis. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying aberrant
      T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 expression in human colorectal cancer
      have not been well defined. To investigate the relationship between
      methylation status and expression levels of T-lymphoma invasion and
      metastasis 1 gene, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and
      immunohistochemistry staining were performed in 232 matched samples of
      human colorectal cancer tissue and normal colorectal mucosa. Results
      showed that T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 protein was overexpressed
      in colorectal cancer, especially in metastatic cases (P &lt; .001). The
      degree of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 promoter methylation was a
      little lower in cancer tissues than in matched normal mucosa (P &lt; .05),
      and the expression level of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 was
      inversely related to the methylation status in cancer tissues (P &lt; .001).
      Colon cancer cell lines HT29 and LS174T were treated with demethylating
      agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, resulting in promoter hypomethylation
      accompanied by reexpression of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 mRNA
      and protein. In contrast, colon cancer cell lines SW620 and LoVo were
      treated with hypermethylation agent S-adenosylmethionine, resulting in
      T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 promoter hypermethylation,
      accompanied by suppression of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1
      expression and inhibition of cell growth, plate colony formation, and
      migration. The present study demonstrates that overexpression of
      T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 is associated with hypomethylation
      status of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 promoter region in
      colorectal cancer tissues. It suggests that promotor hypomethylation of
      T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 may play a role in the progression
      and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Pharmacologic reversal of T-lymphoma
      invasion and metastasis 1 promoter hypomethylation may inhibit cell
      proliferation and migration.

TI  - Potential role of minichromosome maintenance protein 2 as a screening
      biomarker in esophageal cancer high-risk population in China.
AB  - Minichromosome maintenance proteins are novel proliferative markers that
      have been proposed as diagnostic markers in many cancers. We evaluated the
      potential role of minichromosome maintenance protein 2 as a screening
      biomarker and compared it with proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67
      in a population survey of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. A total of
      299 esophageal samples from a high-risk region in China, including 171
      from an endoscopy population survey, 30 from brushing cytology, and 98
      from surgery and autopsy, underwent immunostaining with minichromosome
      maintenance protein 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and Ki67
      antibodies. Minichromosome maintenance protein 2 expression was confined
      to the proliferative compartment of normal and abnormal esophageal
      epithelium and particularly manifested in the surface layer of dysplasia
      and carcinoma in situ. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear
      antigen and Ki67 was positively correlated with that of minichromosome
      maintenance protein 2 (r(s) &gt;0.39, P &lt; .01); but their positive nuclei
      seldom reached the surface layer, and the labeling indices were
      significantly lower than those for minichromosome maintenance protein 2 in
      dysplasia (P &lt; .05) and carcinoma in situ (P &lt; .001). The sensitivity and
      specificity of minichromosome maintenance protein 2 in diagnosing
      dysplasia were 91.3% and 61.8%, respectively, higher than those for
      proliferating cell nuclear antigen (88.4% and 47.1%) and Ki67 (78.3% and
      57.8%). Nine of 10 cancer and paracancerous surface-brushing samples
      expressed minichromosome maintenance protein 2, and the detection was
      higher than that for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (8/10 and 7/10)
      and Ki67 (7/10 and 7/10). However, none of 10 normal surface-brushing
      samples expressed the 3 markers. Minichromosome maintenance protein 2 is
      more sensitive and specific than proliferating cell nuclear antigen and
      Ki67 in indicating esophageal dysplasia. Minichromosome maintenance
      protein 2 immunostaining combined with surface brushing could be valuable
      in screening patients at high risk of cancer in mass surveys.

TI  - BST-2 is rapidly down-regulated from the cell surface by the HIV-1 protein
      Vpu: Evidence for a post-ER mechanism of Vpu-action.
PG  - 65-77
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions are
      essential for HIV-1 Vpu-mediated antagonism of the restriction factor
      BST-2/tetherin. We made Vpu TMD mutants to study the mechanism of BST-2
      antagonism. Vpu-I17A, -A18F, -W22L, and -S23L co-localized with BST-2
      within endosomal membranes while effectively enhancing virion release and
      down-regulating surface BST-2. However, Vpu-A18H was confined to an
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like distribution, resulting in impaired
      down-regulation of BST-2 and reduced virion release. Brefeldin A confined
      wild type Vpu to the ER, resulting in a similarly impaired phenotype, as
      did the addition of a C-terminal ER-retention signal to Vpu. We determined
      the half-life of cell-surface BST-2 to be ~8hours, whereas Vpu mediated an
      ~80% reduction of surface BST-2 within 6hours, suggesting that TMD
      interactions between Vpu and BST-2 occur within post-ER membranes to
      directly and rapidly remove BST-2 from the cell surface and relieve
      restricted virion release.

TI  - Mesoporous silica hybrid membranes for precise size-exclusive separation
      of silver nanoparticles.
PG  - 348-58
AB  - One-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials have unique applications due to their
      inherent physical properties. In this study, hexagonally ordered
      mesoporous silica hybrid anodic alumina membranes (AAM) were synthesized
      using template-guided synthesis with a number of nonionic
      n-alkyl-oligo(ethylene oxide), Brij-type (C(x)EO(y)), which are
      surfactants that have different molecular sizes and characteristics. The
      hexagonal mesoporous silicas are vertically aligned in the AAM channels
      with a predominantly columnar orientation. The hollow mesostructured
      silicas had tunable pore diameters varying from 3.7 to 5.1nm. In this
      synthesis protocol, the surfactant molecular natures (corona/core
      features) are important for the controlled generation of ordered
      structures throughout AAM channels. The development of ultrafiltration
      membranes composed of silica mesostructures could be used effectively in
      separating silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in both aqueous and organic
      solution phases. This would be relevant to the production of well-defined
      Ag NPs with unique properties. To create a size-exclusive separation
      system of Ag NPs, we grafted hydrophobic trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups onto
      the inner pores of the mesoporous silica hybrid AAM. The immobilization of
      the TMS groups allowed the columnar mesoporous silica inside AAM to retain
      this inner pore order without distortion during the separation of
      solution-phase Ag NPs in organic solvents that may cause tortuous-pore
      membranes. Mesoporous TMS-silicas inside 1D AAM channels were applicable
      as a size-exclusive separation system to isolate organic solution-phase Ag
      NPs of uniform morphology and size.

TI  - Detection of TGIF1 homeobox gene in oral squamous cell carcinoma according
      to histologic grading.
PG  - 218-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: TGIF1 homeobox gene involvement in oral cancer has not yet been
      investigated. This study analyzed the expression of TGIF1 transcripts and
      protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). STUDY DESIGN: Snap-frozen
      samples from 16 patients were taken from both OSCC and nontumoral adjacent
      epithelium (NT) for in situ hybridization (ISH). Forty-six
      paraffin-embedded samples of OSCC were submitted to immunohistochemistry
      (IHC). A descriptive analysis of the transcript signal detection was
      accomplished, and TGIF1 immunoexpression was carried out considering
      protein levels, localization, and cellular differentiation. RESULTS: ISH
      reactions showed TGIF1 transcripts with a signal that was frequently
      intense in NT, and generally weak in OSCC, and that had stronger
      transcript signal in well-differentiated areas of OSCC when compared with
      poorly differentiated ones. IHC reactions had poorly differentiated cases
      associated with TGIF1 protein expression in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
      (P = .05, Fisher test). CONCLUSIONS: TGIF1 gain or loss of function might
      possibly play a role in oral cancer cell differentiation.

TI  - CD27 and CD38 lymphocytes are detected in oral lichen planus lesions.
PG  - 211-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic disease with bandlike
      lymphocyte infiltration. STUDY DESIGN: To elucidate the immunologic
      phenotype of OLP, we analyzed the presence of CD5(+), CD20(+), CD27(+)
      and/or CD38(+) lymphocytes in a series of 70 atrophic OLP biopsy samples.
      RESULTS: CD27(+) and CD38(+) cells were present in 84% and 54% of the
      lesions, respectively. The lesions were graded as T-cell dominant, B-cell
      dominant, or a mixed lesion based on CD5(+) and CD20(+) cells in the
      inflammatory infiltration with the following results: 26%, 7%, and 67%,
      respectively. CD27 expression was found in 67% of the T-cell dominant, in
      80% of the B-cell dominant, and in 91% of mixed lesions. The corresponding
      figures for CD38 were 72%, 80%, and 62%. CONCLUSIONS: CD27(+) and CD38(+)
      lymphocytes represent abnormal mononuclear cell populations in atrophic
      OLP lesions indicating 2 forms of OLP might exist with different
      pathogenesis, despite similar histology and clinical behavior.

PG  - 49-63
AB  - There are several artifacts encountered in positron emission
      tomography/computed tomographic (PET/CT) imaging, including attenuation
      correction (AC) artifacts associated with using CT for AC. Several
      artifacts can mimic a 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) avid
      malignant lesions and therefore recognition of these artifacts is
      clinically relevant. Our goal was to identify and characterize these
      artifacts and also discuss some protocol variables that may affect image
      quality in PET/CT.

TI  - CT evaluation of pulmonary venous anatomy variation in patients undergoing
      catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - To characterize pulmonary vein (PV) anatomy and the relative position of
      the PV ostia to the adjacent thoracic vertebral bodies, two readers
      reviewed 176 computed tomography pulmonary venous studies. PV ostial
      dimensions were measured and PV ovality assessed. Anatomical variations in
      PV drainage were noted. The position of the PV ostium relative to the
      nearest vertebral body edge was recorded. Right PV ostia were
      significantly more circular than the left (p&lt;.001). Anatomical variability
      was greater for right PVs: 82% of patients had 2 ostia, 17% had 3 ostia,
      0.5% had 4 ostia and 0.5% a common ostium. For left PVs, 91% of patients
      had 2 ostia, 8.5% a common ostium and 0.5% 3 ostia. Mean ostial distances
      from vertebral margin were: right PVs 3.62+/-7.48 mm; left PVs 3.84+/-8.46
      mm (p=.72). 65% of right upper PV, 60.5% of right lower PV, 51% of left
      upper PV and 57% of left lower PV ostia were positioned lateral to
      vertebral bodies. Right PV ostia are rounder than left-sided and right PV
      drainage is more variable. As a significant proportion of PV ostia overlap
      the vertebral bodies, prior anatomical evaluation by CT can assist
      catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF), especially when
      performed under fluoroscopy.

TI  - [Affective disorders: News in chronobiological models].
PG  - S157-66
AB  - Good news on chronobiological models of affective disorders are coming
      from a therapeutic innovation in the field of antidepressive action.
      Coming back to fundamentals by reconsidering the importance of the role of
      biological rhythms impairment in dysthymic pathology, a new interest bored
      on studies exploring short periodicities, so-called &quot;ultradian&quot; ones, on
      the basis of pharmacodynamics in the concept of therapeutic &quot;window&quot; of
      administration. The priority of circadian rhythms due to the major
      external biological desynchronization in depression, as well as the
      importance of sleep and alertness pathology, the spectacular relief of the
      depressive mood upon sleep deprivation, and the strong reduction of sleep
      need in mania, delayed exploration of ultradian exaltation of harmonic
      circadian components, marking a &quot;buzz&quot; of rhythmic structure and calling a
      &quot;chronobiotic compound&quot; which would be able to apply a &quot;reset&quot; to the
      temporal organisation. Another return to the origin leads to the
      experimental genomics, informing nor the &quot;depressivity&quot; but manic
      pathogenesis, in a mouse gene model which queries on the share of
      addictive and affective disorders.

TI  - [New insights in growth hormone physiology and pathophysiology].
PG  - S25-32
AB  - This review focuses on new aspects in growth hormone (GH) biology and
      pathophysiology presented at the Endocrine Society's meeting, in San
      Diego, in June 2010. First, we will describe recent advances in the
      understanding of cytokine hormone signaling via STAT5 in mammary gland
      development, highlighting the primary role of miR193b for differentiation
      of mammary stem cells into alveolar progenitor cells. We will examine the
      potential implication of endocrine and autocrine GH for mammary gland
      carcinogenesis. Three novel murine models bearing tissue-specific
      inactivation of GH receptor or JAK2 bring new insights into the large
      spectrum of GH effects on energy homeostasis. We will also report new data
      supporting a paracrine regulation of GH secretion in women by estrogen's
      action in the brain. Thereafter we will question the reasons for GH abuse
      for doping by assessing the hormonal impact on body composition and
      physical performance in recreational athletes. Finally, we will discuss
      the controversial issue of GH replacement in acromegalic patients
      presenting GH deficiency after treatment of acromegaly.

TI  - Direct and bystander effects induced by scattered radiation generated
      during penetration of radiation inside a water-phantom.
PG  - 6-14
AB  - In this study, the dose distribution of photon (6MV) and electron (22MeV)
      radiation in a water-phantom was compared with the frequency of apoptotic
      and micronucleated cells of two human cell lines (BEAS-2B normal bronchial
      epithelial cells and A549 lung cancer epithelial cells). Formation of
      micronuclei and apoptotic-like bodies was evaluated by the
      cytokinesis-block micronucleus test. Measurements were performed for five
      different phantom depths (3-20cm). Irradiated cells were placed in a
      water-phantom in three variants: directly on the axis in the beam, under
      shielding (only in photon radiation) and outside the beam field. The
      results reveal a discrepancy between the distribution of physical dose at
      different depths of the water-phantom and biological effects. This
      discrepancy is of special significance in case of cells irradiated at a
      greater depth or placed outside the field and under shield during the
      exposure to radiation. The frequency of cytogenetic damage was higher than
      the expected value based on the physical dose received at different
      depths. Cells placed outside the beam axis were exposed to scattered
      radiation at very low doses, so we tested if bystander effects could have
      had a role in the observed discrepancy between physical radiation dose and
      biological response. We explored this question by use of a medium-transfer
      technique in which medium (ICM-irradiation conditioned medium) from
      irradiated cells was transferred to non-irradiated (bystander) cells. The
      results indicate that when cells were incubated in ICM transferred from
      cells irradiated at bigger depths or from cells exposed outside the
      radiation field, the number of apoptotic and micronucleated cells was
      similar to that after direct irradiation. This suggests that these damages
      are caused by factors released by irradiated cells into the medium rather
      than being induced directly in DNA by X-rays. Evaluation of biological
      effects of scattered radiation appears useful for clinical practice.

TI  - Development of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for
      Delta(12)-prostaglandin J(2) and its application to the measurement of the
      endogenous product generated by cultured adipocytes during the maturation
      phase.
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma is a well-known
      master regulator for the differentiation and maturation of adipocytes.
      Prostaglandin (PG) D(2) can be produced in adipocytes and dehydrated to
      J(2) series of PGs including 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) and
      Delta(12)-PGJ(2), which serve as pro-adipogenic prostanoids through the
      activation of PPARgamma. However, the quantitative determination of
      Delta(12)-PGJ(2) has not been attempted during the life stage of
      adipocytes. In this study, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay using mouse antiserum specific for Delta(12)-PGJ(2). According to
      the standard curve, the amount of Delta(12)-PGJ(2) can be measured from
      0.5pg to 14.4ng in an assay. Our antiserum did not recognize most other
      prostanoids including 15d-PGJ(2), while it only showed the cross-reaction
      of 28% with unstable PGJ(2). This immunological assay was applied to the
      determination of the endogenous formation of Delta(12)-PGJ(2) in cultured
      3T3-L1 adipocytes during the maturation phase. The ability of cultured
      adipocytes to form endogenous Delta(12)-PGJ(2) increased gradually at an
      earlier stage of the maturation phase and detectable at higher levels than
      15d-PGJ(2). Treatment of cultured cells with either aspirin or
      indomethacin, a general cyclooxygenase inhibitor, significantly reduced
      the production of endogenous Delta(12)-PGJ(2) in the maturation medium as
      expected. Furthermore, we evaluated individually the exogenous effects of
      PGJ(2) series at various doses on adipogenesis during the maturation
      phase. Although Delta(12)-PGJ(2) was slightly less potent than 15d-PGJ(2),
      each of these PGJ(2) series rescued effectively both the accumulation of
      fats and the gene expression of typical adipocyte-markers that were
      attenuated in the presence of aspirin. Taken together, our findings
      indicate that endogenous Delta(12)-PGJ(2) contributes substantially to the
      up-regulation of adipogenesis program through the activation of PPARgamma
      together with 15d-PGJ(2) during the maturation phase of cultured
      adipocytes.

TI  - A learning-based wrapper method to correct systematic errors in automatic
      image segmentation: Consistently improved performance in hippocampus,
      cortex and brain segmentation.
AB  - We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the
      accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual
      segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis that a large
      fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation are systematic,
      i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject, and serves as a wrapper
      method around a given host segmentation method. The wrapper method
      attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual patterns
      associated with systematic segmentation errors produced by the host method
      on training data for which manual segmentations are available. The method
      then attempts to correct such errors in segmentations produced by the host
      method on new images. One practical use of the proposed wrapper method is
      to adapt existing segmentation tools, without explicit modification, to
      imaging data and segmentation protocols that are different from those on
      which the tools were trained and tuned. An open-source implementation of
      the proposed wrapper method is provided, and can be applied to a wide
      range of image segmentation problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with
      four host brain MRI segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using
      FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using
      multi-atlas label fusion (Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction
      using BET (Smith, 2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang
      et al., 2001). The wrapper method generates 72%, 14%, 29% and 21% fewer
      erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation
      methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label
      fusion as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference
      segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908
      for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment.
      Average Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain
      extraction, white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation,
      respectively.

TI  - Effect of casting solvent on crystallinity of ondansetron in transdermal
      films.
PG  - 106-10
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation is to assess the influence of
      casting solvent on crystallinity of ondansetron hydrochloride in
      transdermal polymeric matrix films fabricated using povidone and ethyl
      cellulose as matrix forming polymers. Various casting solvents like
      chloroform (CHL), dichloromethane (DCM), methanol (MET); and mixture of
      chloroform and ethanol (C-ETH) were used for fabrication of the
      transdermal films. Analytical tools like scanning electron microscopy
      (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, differential scanning calorimetry
      (DSC), etc. were utilized to characterize the crystalline state of
      ondansetron in the film. Recrystallisation was observed in all the
      transdermal films fabricated using the casting solvents other than
      chloroform. Long thin slab-looking, long wire-like or spherulite-looking
      crystals with beautiful impinged boundaries were observed in SEM.
      Moreover, XRD revealed no crystalline peaks of ondansetron hydrochloride
      in the transdermal films prepared using chloroform as casting solvent. The
      significantly decreased intensity and sharpness of the DSC endothermic
      peaks corresponding to the melting point of ondansetron in the formulation
      (specifically in CHL) indicated partial dissolution of ondansetron
      crystals in the polymeric films. The employed analytical tools suggested
      chloroform as a preferred casting solvent with minimum or practically
      absence of recrystallization indicating a relatively amorphous state of
      ondansetron in transdermal films.

TI  - The X protein of HBV induces HIV-1 long terminal repeat transcription by
      enhancing the binding of C/EBPbeta and CREB1/2 regulatory proteins to the
      long terminal repeat of HIV-1.
AB  - Due to share the route of transmission, the prevalence of co-infection of
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is high
      with chronic HBV infection affecting nearly 10% of HIV-infected patient
      world wide, which has become a significant global health problem. However,
      the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with HBV/HIV-1
      co-infection are largely unclear. In this study, we provided evidence that
      HBV induces HIV-1 transcription through its X protein (HBx). We further
      explored the mechanism by which HBx activates HIV-1 transcription. Our
      results showed that C/EBP and CRE cis-regulatory elements in the long
      terminal repeats (LTR) of HIV-1 are required for the activation of HIV-1
      transcription mediated by HBx. We also demonstrated that HBx regulates
      HIV-1 transcription through stimulating the binding of transcriptional
      regulatory proteins C/EBPbeta, CREB1, and CREB2 to HIV-1 LTR and that
      co-activator CBP is required for such regulation. These findings provide
      new insights into our understanding the effect of HBx on the activation of
      HIV-1 transcription and also provide evidence of the potential role of HBV
      in HIV-1 replication during the course of HBV/HIV-1 co-infection.

TI  - Acipimox during exercise points to an inhibitory feedback of GH on ghrelin
      secretion in bulimic and healthy women.
PG  - 134-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ghrelin is predominantly produced by the stomach and the growth
      hormone (GH)-ghrelin feedback loop between the stomach and the pituitary
      gland has recently been suggested. The disruption of the gut-brain axis
      might be involved in bulimia nervosa (BN). METHODS: We investigated
      responses of plasma GH, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) concentrations
      to exercise or to exercise after the administration of the antilipolytic
      drug Acipimox (Aci) in seven BN patients and seven healthy women (C). Aci
      was administered 1h before exercise (45min, 2W/kg of lean body mass/LBM/).
      Ghrelin, GH, NPY, free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol plasma levels were
      measured during the test using commercial kits. RESULTS: The exercise
      induced an increase in plasma GH, NPY and FFA in both groups and a
      decrease in plasma ghrelin levels only in BN patients. Exercise after Aci
      administration resulted in an increase in plasma GH, and a decrease in
      plasma ghrelin in both groups; NPY increased more in BN patients.
      Exercise-induced FFA increase was depressed after Aci. CONCLUSIONS: We
      conclude that the Aci-induced suppression in plasma ghrelin levels during
      exercise in both groups suggests a negative feedback of GH on ghrelin
      secretion. Observed changes in plasma FFA levels were not related to
      changes in GH and ghrelin levels.

TI  - Ethanol extract from birch bark (Betula pubescens) suppresses human
      dendritic cell mediated Th1 responses and directs it towards a Th17
      regulatory response in vitro.
AB  - Extracts and fractions from birch bark have been used to treat various
      diseases, such as skin disorders and rheumatism, and for analgesic
      effects. Results from studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that birch
      bark extracts can have immunoregulatory effects. These effects have mainly
      been attributed to the various triterpenes found in birch bark. The
      effects of birch bark from Betula pubescens on immune responses have not
      been reported. Ethanol extract was prepared from dry birch bark (DBBEE)
      and five fractions made using various ratios of dichloromethane and
      methanol (fractions I-V). Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs)
      were matured with or without DBBEE or fractions I-V at several
      concentrations. The effects of the extract and fractions on DC maturation
      were determined by measuring cytokine secretion by ELISA and expression of
      surface molecules by flow cytometry. DBBEE and fractions III and IV
      reduced DC secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12p40 and expression of CD83,
      CD86, CCR7 and DC-SIGN compared with control DCs. Proliferation of
      allogeneic CD4(+) T cells co-cultured with DCs matured with fraction IV,
      as measured by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, was similar to proliferation
      of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells co-cultured with control DCs. However,
      IFN-gamma secretion was reduced and IL-10 and IL-17 secretion was
      increased, a cytokine profile consistent with a Th17 regulatory phenotype.
      These results indicate that bark from Betula pubescens contains
      compound(s) that can modulate DCs so that their interaction with T cells
      leads to an immunoregulatory response.

TI  - Deep resequencing of serial sputum isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      during therapeutic failure due to poor compliance reveals stepwise
      mutation of key resistance genes on an otherwise stable genetic
      background.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has generally been held that the repeated emergence of
      resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is due to the effects of large
      population sizes, slow replication, and prolonged colonization and
      treatment. However, there have been suggestions that its emergence is
      facilitated by high mutation rates due to a lack of mismatch repair,
      error-prone polymerases, and a potentially mutagenic host niche. Genome
      re-sequencing has indicated higher variability in strains with emergent
      resistance, but these studies have not been performed in serial isolates
      in which drug resistance has emerged. We have used genome re-sequencing to
      address the mutational processes that occur during the evolution of drug
      resistance during a clinical infection. METHODS: Serial isolates from a
      patient obtained over a 12 month period, and spanning the transition of
      the colonizing population from fully drug sensitive, to isoniazid
      resistant, to isoniazid and rifampicin (multiply drug) resistant, spanning
      an estimated minimum of 100 generations within the host, were deep
      sequenced using Illumina sequencing. The genomes were compared, and all
      mutations in non-repetitive sequences were identified. RESULTS: Specific
      mutations conferring resistance were identified. No additional mutations
      in non-repetitive regions were present. The mutations observed were kat
      S315T and rpoB D516Y. CONCLUSIONS: M. tuberculosis is relatively stable
      genetically within the host, and demonstrates greater stability than is
      suggested by in vitro studies of emergent drug resistance, or by models of
      hypermutability. This indicates that it is primarily the nature and
      duration of the infection that are sufficient to lead to the repeated
      emergence of drug resistance in this infection if improperly managed, and
      that the selective pressure of the drugs limits additional
      diversification. This emphasizes the central importance of maintaining
      therapeutic concentrations of at least two effective antibiotics for the
      duration of treatment to prevent the emergence of resistance.

TI  - The neuropsychiatry of neuroacanthocytosis syndromes.
AB  - The neuroacanthocytoses are a group of disorders characterised by
      peripheral blood acanthocytes, central nervous system as well as
      neuromuscular symptoms. These disorders uniformly result in pathology in
      the basal ganglia, which account for the characteristic motor symptoms
      such as chorea or dystonia, but may also account for the apparent elevated
      rates of major mental disorders in these syndromes. Elevated rates of
      dysexecutive syndromes, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and
      schizophrenia-like psychosis appear to occur in chorea-acanthocytosis,
      McLeod's syndrome, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and
      Huntington's disease-like 2. Disruptions to key frontostriatal loops
      secondary to pathology in the striatum and pallidum appear to predispose
      individuals to major neuropsychiatric syndromes; however, treatment can be
      instituted for a number of these manifestations, which lessens the overall
      burden of disease in neuroacanthocytosis patients and their families.

TI  - A statistical-reaction-diffusion approach for analyzing expansion
      processes.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - In this article, we propose a method for analyzing the spatial variations
      in the range expansion of the pine processionary moth (PPM), an invasive
      species in France. Based on binary measurements - the presence or absence
      of PPM nests - the proposed method allows us to infer the local effect of
      the environment on PPM population expansion. This effect is estimated at
      each position x using a parameter F(x) that corresponds to the local PPM
      fitness. The data type and the two stage PPM life cycle make estimating
      this parameter difficult. To overcome these difficulties we adopt a
      mechanistic-statistical approach that combines a statistical model for the
      observation process with a hierarchical,reaction-diffusion based
      mechanistic model for the expansion process. Bayesian inference of the
      parameter F(x) reveals that PPM fitness is spatially heterogeneous and
      highlights the existence of large regions associated with lower fitness.
      The factors underlying this lower fitness are yet to be determined.

TI  - Initiation of Translation of the FMR1 mRNA Occurs Predominantly through
      5'-End-Dependent Ribosomal Scanning.
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene contains a CGG repeat
      within its 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) that, when expanded to 55-200
      CGG repeats (premutation allele), can result in the late-onset
      neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.
      The CGG repeat is expected to form a highly stable secondary structure
      that is capable of inhibiting 5'-cap-dependent translation. Paradoxically,
      translation in vivo is only mildly impaired within the premutation range,
      suggesting that other modes of translation initiation may be operating. To
      address this issue, we translated in vitro a set of reporter mRNAs
      containing between 0 and 99 CGG repeats in either native (FMR1) or
      unrelated (heterologous) 5'UTR context. The 5'-cap dependence of
      translation was assessed by inserting a stable hairpin (HP) near the 5'
      end of the mRNAs. The results of the current studies indicate that
      translation initiation of the FMR1 mRNA occurs primarily by scanning, with
      little evidence of internal ribosome entry or shunting. Additionally, the
      efficiency of translation initiation depends on transcription start site
      selection, with the shorter 5'UTR (downstream transcription start site I)
      translating with greater efficiency compared to the longer mRNA (start
      site III) for all CGG-repeat elements studied. Lastly, an HP previously
      shown to block translation gave differing results depending on the 5'UTR
      context, in one case initiating translation from within the HP.

TI  - The Epithelial Barrier Is Maintained by In Vivo Tight Junction Expansion
      During Pathologic Intestinal Epithelial Shedding.
AB  - BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) increases intestinal
      epithelial cell shedding and apoptosis, potentially challenging the
      barrier between the gastrointestinal lumen and internal tissues. We
      investigated the mechanism of tight junction remodeling and barrier
      maintenance as well as the roles of cytoskeletal regulatory molecules
      during TNF-induced shedding. METHODS: We studied wild-type and transgenic
      mice that express the fluorescent-tagged proteins enhanced green
      fluorescent protein-occludin or monomeric red fluorescent protein 1-ZO-1.
      After injection of high doses of TNF (7.5 mug intraperitoneally),
      laparotomies were performed and segments of small intestine were opened to
      visualize the mucosa by video confocal microscopy. Pharmacologic
      inhibitors and knockout mice were used to determine the roles of caspase
      activation, actomyosin, and microtubule remodeling and membrane
      trafficking in epithelial shedding. RESULTS: Changes detected included
      redistribution of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin to lateral
      membranes of shedding cells. These proteins ultimately formed a funnel
      around the shedding cell that defined the site of barrier preservation.
      Claudins, E-cadherin, F-actin, myosin II, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK),
      and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) were also recruited to lateral
      membranes. Caspase activity, myosin motor activity, and microtubules were
      required to initiate shedding, whereas completion of the process required
      microfilament remodeling and ROCK, MLCK, and dynamin II activities.
      CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance of the epithelial barrier during TNF-induced cell
      shedding is a complex process that involves integration of microtubules,
      microfilaments, and membrane traffic to remove apoptotic cells. This
      process is accompanied by redistribution of apical junctional complex
      proteins to form intercellular barriers between lateral membranes and
      maintain mucosal function.

TI  - The role of the C-terminus of human alpha-synuclein: Intra-disulfide bonds
      between the C-terminus and other regions stabilize non-fibrillar monomeric
      isomers.
PG  - 561-6
AB  - Substantial evidence implicates that the aggregation of alpha-synuclein
      (alphaSyn) is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's
      disease. This study focuses on the role of alphaSyn C-terminus. We
      introduced two additional cysteine residues at positions 107 and 124
      (A107C and A124C) to our previous construct. Five X-isomers of
      oxidative-folded mutation of alpha-synuclein with three disulfides were
      isolated and their secondary structures and aggregating features were
      analyzed. All isomers showed similar random coil structures as wild-type
      alpha-synuclein. However, these isomers did not form aggregates or
      fibrils, even with prolonged incubation, suggesting that the interactions
      between the C-terminal and N-terminal or central NAC region are important
      in maintaining the natively unfolded structure of alphaSyn and thus
      prevent alphaSyn from changing conformation, which is a critical step for
      fibrillation.

TI  - Glycine amide shielding on the aromatic surfaces of lysozyme: Implication
      for suppression of protein aggregation.
PG  - 555-60
AB  - Glycine amide (GlyAd), a typically amidated amino acid, is a versatile
      additive that suppresses protein aggregation during refolding, heat
      treatment, and crystallization. In spite of its effectiveness, the exact
      mechanism by which GlyAd suppresses protein aggregation remains to be
      elucidated. Here, we show the crystal structure of the GlyAd-lysozyme
      complex by high resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis at a 1.05A
      resolution. GlyAd bound to the lysozyme surface near aromatic residues and
      decreased the amount of bound waters and increased the mobility of
      protein. Arg and GlyAd molecules are different in binding sites and
      patterns from glycerol and related compounds, indicating that decreasing
      hydrophobic patches might be involved in suppression of protein
      aggregation.

TI  - Effects of fetal exposure to lipopolysaccharide, perinatal anoxia and
      sensorimotor restriction on motor skills and musculoskeletal tissue:
      Implications for an animal model of cerebral palsy.
AB  - Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder of locomotion, posture and movement that
      can be caused by prenatal, perinatal or postnatal insults during brain
      development. An increased incidence of CP has been correlated to perinatal
      asphyxia and maternal infections during gestation. The effects of maternal
      exposure to low doses of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) on
      motor behavior and hind leg muscle morphology were examined in young adult
      rats. Prenatal exposure to LPS was also studied in association with
      perinatal anoxia (PA) and/or combined with subsequent sensorimotor
      restriction (SR) and all possible combinations of the three conditions.
      Rats exposed to LPS, PA and SR alone or combined (LPS+PA, LPS+SR, PA+SR,
      and LPS+PA+SR) showed deficits in balance and coordination when tested on
      the Rotarod. The SR groups, with or without other insults, (SR, LPS+SR,
      PA+SR, and LPS+PA+SR) exhibited the greatest motor deficits, characterized
      by the reduced ability to perform the horizontal ladder and suspended bar
      tests on postnatal day 29 (P29) and P45. Histological assessment revealed
      substantial morphological alterations in the slow ankle extensor soleus
      muscle of all SR rats. Soleus myofibers presented a reduction in
      cross-sectional area (CSA), an increase in sarcomere length and a decrease
      in sarcomere density. The CSA of the fast flexor tibialis anterior muscle
      was only decreased by the association of all treatments (LPS, PA, SR), but
      no differences were found in sarcomere length and density when compared to
      control. A slow-to-fast fiber type transition was only observed in the
      soleus and tibialis anterior muscles in the SR groups. These results
      suggest that exposure to LPS during the prenatal period, PA, SR alone or
      in combination has various degrees of consequences on motor behavior and
      muscle morphology. These data corroborate the concept that early
      experience-dependent movements play the most important role in shaping
      motor behavior and that reduced or anomalous sensorimotor experience can
      contribute to the development of aberrant motor behavior and muscle
      morphology.

TI  - Correlation between fetal brain activity patterns and behavioral states:
      An exploratory fetal magnetoencephalography study.
AB  - The fetal brain remains inaccessible to neurophysiological studies.
      Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is being assessed to fill this gap. We
      performed 40 fetal MEG (fMEG) recordings with gestational ages (GA)
      ranging from 30 to 37weeks. The data from each recording were divided into
      15 second epochs which in turn were classified as continuous (CO),
      discontinuous (DC), or artifact. The fetal behavioral state, quiet or
      active sleep, was determined using previously defined criteria based on
      fetal movements and heart rate variability. We studied the correlation
      between the fetal state, the GA and the percentage of CO and DC epochs. We
      also analyzed the spectral edge frequency (SEF) and studied its relation
      with state and GA. We found that the odds of a DC epoch decreased by 6%
      per week as the GA increased (P=0.0036). This decrease was mainly
      generated by changes during quiet sleep, which showed 52% DC epochs before
      a 35week GA versus 38% after 35weeks (P=0.0006). Active sleep did not show
      a significant change in DC epochs with GA. When both states were compared
      for MEG patterns within each GA group (before and after 35weeks), the
      early group was found to have more DC epochs in quiet sleep (54%) compared
      to active sleep (42%) (P=0.036). No significant difference in DC epochs
      between the two states was noted in the late GA group. Analysis of SEF
      showed a significant difference (P=0.0014) before and after a 35week GA,
      with higher SEF noted at late GA. However, when both quiet and active
      sleep states were compared within each GA group, the SEF did not show a
      significant difference. We conclude that fMEG shows reproducible
      variations in gross features and frequency content, depending on GA and
      behavioral state. Fetal MEG is a promising tool to investigate fetal brain
      physiology and maturation.

TI  - Effects of two oral antidiabetics, pioglitazone and repaglinide, on
      aconitase inactivation, inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress in
      tissues under alloxan-induced hyperglycemia.
AB  - Pathological changes identified in different tissues in hyperglycemic
      state are undoubtedly connected with increased oxidative/nitrosative
      stress and inflammation. In our study myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitrotyrosine
      and lipid peroxidation were enhanced in the heart and lung of
      alloxan-treated hyperglycemic animals. Additionally, pulmonary aconitase
      was inhibited. In the testis the changes occurred as an increase of MPO
      and lipid peroxidation, and as a decrease of aconitase. The effects of two
      different antidiabetics, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
      gamma (PPARgamma) agonist, pioglitazone, and a short acting insulin
      secretagogue, repaglinide, on the mentioned parameters, were investigated
      and compared. The insulin deficient alloxan-induced hyperglycemic animals
      were used to differentiate a direct anti-oxidative effect of the drugs
      from secondary effects mediated via increased insulin sensitivity or
      secretion. Pioglitazone acted by normalization of pulmonary and testicular
      aconitase, normalization of pulmonary and cardiac nitrotyrosine, reduction
      of pulmonary and testicular MPO, and by reduction of lipid peroxidation in
      all tissues examined. Repaglinide prevented oxidative changes by
      normalization of aconitase activity in the lung and testis, and by
      reduction of lipid peroxidation and nitrotyrosine in the heart and lung.
      At the same time, no effect of this drug on MPO was observed. Finally,
      principal component analysis was performed to explore and visualize
      similarities and differences of the results obtained for the both drugs.

TI  - Component positioning in primary total hip replacement: A prospective
      comparative study of two anterolateral approaches, minimally invasive
      versus gluteus medius hemimyotomy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One factor of implant survivorship in total hip replacement
      (THR) is the quality of implant choice and positioning. The purported
      advantages of minimally invasive approaches are faster recovery, shorter
      hospital stay and less per-operative blood loss. On the other hand, there
      have been many reports of higher complication rates, and doubts as to the
      quality of implant positioning. HYPOTHESIS: The quest to minimize tissue
      damage is at the cost of THR positioning quality. OBJECTIVES: To assess
      implant positioning in a prospective comparative continuous multicenter
      series. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, a prospective
      comparative study was conducted on a continuous series of 141 THRs.
      Ninety-two were performed in two centers, using a minimally invasive
      Watson-Jones approach; the other 49, performed in a 3rd center, used an
      anterolateral approach with anterior hemimyotomy. The surgeons were in all
      cases experienced in their technique. Short-term follow-up comprised
      clinical and functional (Postel Merle d'Aubigne (PMA), Harris, SF12,
      WOMAC) and biological assessment (serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK),
      myoglobinemia, hematocrit) and analysis of complications and of implant
      positioning on X-ray and CT-scan. RESULTS: On the Watson-Jones approach,
      surgery time was longer; day-1 analgesic administration was lower; PMA,
      Harris and WOMAC scores were better at 6 weeks; and CPK levels were lower
      at 24 and 48hours. There were no significant differences on the other
      clinical and biological criteria. Implant positioning analysis revealed
      significantly greater combined anteversion and greater variation in
      acetabular inclination mean with the Watson-Jones approach, but no
      differences in cup positioning, femoral stem positioning, or limb length
      discrepancy. DISCUSSION: The minimally invasive Watson-Jones approach
      provided faster recovery and less muscular damage. However, implant
      positioning was less precise in terms of acetabular cup inclination. LEVEL
      OF EVIDENCE: Level III. Prospective, comparative, non-randomized.

TI  - Application of various compositions of thoracodorsal perforator flap for
      craniofacial contour deformities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Craniofacial contour defects are challenging to restore
      because they may involve multiple tissues and span several aesthetic
      subunits in a non-contiguous manner. Some of these deformities may be
      associated with significant dead space in the region of sinus and orbit.
      The numerous subtle contours of the craniofacial regions must be preserved
      or restored to achieve a pleasing outcome. PATIENT AND RESULTS: We managed
      six patients with various craniofacial contour deformities as a result of
      hemifacial microsomia, infection, post excision of venous malformation,
      lipodystrophy, craniectomy for chronic frontal sinusitis and infected
      pneumocephalus. They were reconstructed with thoracodorsal perforator
      flaps bearing various components, that is, adiposal, adipofascial,
      dermoadiposal, adipomyofascial and osteomuscular elements. Half of the
      flaps were in chimaeric form. The largest flap size was 11 x 17 cm. All
      flaps survived and no patient required secondary contouring procedure,
      except for cranioplasty in one patient. CONCLUSION: The thoracodorsal
      perforator flap is very suitable for restoration of craniofacial contour
      deformities. Its advantages include: (1) ease of customisation of size and
      thickness, (2) several choices of donor tissue from the lateral thoracic
      region yielding multiple tissue components, for example, adiposal,
      adipofascial, dermoadiposal, adipomyofascial and osteomuscular flaps, (3)
      presence of adjacent perforators in the thoracodorsal system, allowing
      chimaeric flap configuration, thereby improving adaptation to
      non-contiguous contour defects, (4) ability to tailor the donor and
      recipient vessel size match by varying how proximal to harvest along the
      thoracodorsal vessels, (5) primary closure of donor site and (6) flap
      harvesting in supine position allowing a two-team approach.

TI  - The anterior approach to retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in children:
      Technique.
AB  - PURPOSE: Very limited literature exists on minimally invasive
      adrenalectomy in children. Retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (RPA) has
      the advantage of avoiding intra-abdominal organ retraction, but concerns
      have been expressed regarding RPA on the right side. Herein, we describe
      the second reported experience with the anterior approach to RPA in
      children, which appears to overcome the limitations previously ascribed to
      right RPA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two children, aged 8 and 14-years,
      presented with incidental right adrenal masses. Both patients were placed
      in the lateral decubitus position with lumbar hyper-extension. A 5-mm,
      3-port approach was used, as demonstrated in the video. RESULTS: Pathology
      revealed a 7-cm ganglioneuroma and a 5-cm pheochromocytoma with intact
      surgical margins. Operative time with these large masses and first
      experience with this technique was 5 h in the first case and 3.5 h in the
      second. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were noted, with
      minimal blood loss and a hospital stay of 36 h in both cases. CONCLUSION:
      The anterior approach to RPA is feasible even in children with a smaller
      retroperitoneal space and a large adrenal mass. It provides excellent
      exposure of the adrenal gland and vein, even on the right side.

TI  - IR spectroscopic analysis of polymorphism in C(13)H(14)N(4)O.
PG  - 981-8
AB  - IR analysis is used here to investigate the changes in N-N, N-H, CO modes
      of thermally treated diphenyl carbazide (DPC) during the variation of
      temperature from room temperature up to  approximately 160 degrees C.
      Polymorphism in DPC compound has been studied here by detecting the
      changes in some IR spectroscopic parameters (e.g., mode shift, band
      contour) during the elevation of temperature. Also, DSC, X-ray, NMR and
      atomic mass spectra are used as confirming tools for what is obtained by
      IR. All of the vibrations of DPC were found to be due to ionic
      fundamentals 3311cm(-1), 3097cm(-1), 3052cm(-1), 1677cm(-1), 1602cm(-1),
      1492cm(-1), 1306cm(-1), 1252cm(-1), 887cm(-1) and 755cm(-1). The results
      revealed for the first time that the thermally treated DPC traverse four
      different phase transformations at 50 degrees C, 90 degrees C, 125 degrees
      C and 140 degrees C. The crystal structure was found to be amorphous,
      monoclinic, tetragonal, orthorhombic and amorphous within a temperature
      range (30 degrees C-160 degrees C). X-ray diffraction patterns support the
      results obtained by IR and DSC.

TI  - Secretion, modification, and regulation of Ax21.
PG  - 62-7
AB  - Innate immunity provides a first line of defense against pathogen attack
      and is activated rapidly following infection. Although it is now widely
      appreciated that host receptors of conserved microbial signatures play a
      key role in innate immunity in plants and animals, very little is known
      about the biological function of the microbially derived molecules
      recognized by such receptors. We have recently demonstrated that the rice
      XA21 receptor binds the AxY(S)22 peptide corresponding to the N-terminal
      region of Ax21, a type I-secreted protein that is highly conserved in all
      Xanthomonas species as well as in Xylella fastidiosa and the human
      pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. We hypothesize that
      post-translational modification of Ax21 is carried out by the RaxP, RaxQ,
      and RaxST proteins and that perception and regulation of Ax21 is
      controlled by the RaxR/H and PhoP/Q 2-component regulatory systems. Ax21
      is predicted to serve as an inducer of quorum sensing (QS), a process
      where bacteria communicate with one another. Because this is the first
      example of a conserved microbial signature that binds a host receptor and
      is also predicted to serve as an inducer of QS, this work has revealed
      fundamental new principles governing host-microbe interactions and has
      provided insight into the signaling dynamics of microbial communities.

TI  - Changes in body composition during weight loss in obese subjects in the
      NUGENOB study: Comparison of bioelectrical impedance vs. dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry.
AB  - AIM: We studied the accuracy of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to
      assess changes in body composition during moderate weight loss in obese
      subjects. METHODS: Estimates of changes in fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass
      (FFM) by BIA were compared with those by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
      (DXA) as the reference method during a 10-week standardized weight-loss
      intervention. In obese women (age: 20-50years, mean BMI: 33.8kg/m(2))
      participating in a European multicentre trial (nutrient-gene interactions
      in human obesity [NUGENOB]), body composition was assessed by BIA
      (Bodystat QuadScan 4000) and DXA (Lunar DPX-IQ at two centres, Hologic QDR
      2000 at another centre) at baseline (n=131) and at week 10 (n=105) after a
      mean weight loss of -5.7kg. RESULTS: At baseline, BIA significantly
      overestimated FFM and underestimated FM (by 1-3kg on average) compared
      with DXA, and the limits of agreement were wide (mean+/-7-8.5kg). For
      body-composition changes, although biases were generally non-significant,
      the limits of agreement were also wide (mean+/-3.7-4.6kg). An FFM
      prediction equation for BIA data was developed in subjects scanned with
      Lunar instruments and cross-validated in an independent sample of 31 obese
      women undergoing similar weight loss. However, no major improvement in
      limits of agreement was found. CONCLUSION: During moderate diet-induced
      weight loss, the use of BIA leads to estimates of changes in body
      composition at the individual level that can differ substantially from
      those assessed by DXA, indicating that BIA and DXA cannot be used
      interchangeably. However, BIA in this context may be used for assessing
      changes in body composition at group level.

TI  - Investigation of dogs as a reservoir of Penicillium marneffei in northern
      Thailand.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei is a dimorphic pathogenic fungus endemic
      in Southeast Asia that usually causes disseminated disease, mainly in
      immunocompromised individuals, especially those with HIV infection.
      Untreated cases are usually fatal. The only known natural reservoir exists
      in bamboo rats and there is no firm evidence that these animals are
      involved in direct transmission to humans. The risk of infection is not
      restricted to those living in endemic areas; HIV-infected individuals who
      travel to Southeast Asia have also become infected by P. marneffei. Hence,
      there must exist sources to which even tourists are exposed on a
      short-term basis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Penicillium is known to infect dogs
      and this animal is common in the streets and temple areas of Chiang Mai,
      where there is one of the highest incidences of P. marneffei infection in
      the world. Dogs have not been well studied as a possible reservoir. To
      investigate this possibility, we took nasal swabs from 83 outdoor dogs and
      performed culture and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect P.
      marneffei. RESULTS: We found that approximately 13% of nasal swabs from
      dogs in Chiang Mai, Thailand were positive when tested by two different
      PCR methods, but culture results were negative. Sequencing the products
      from both PCR reactions showed 100% identity with P. marneffei, whereas no
      other known fungi shared both sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
      that dogs might be an animal reservoir for P. marneffei in northern
      Thailand. This observation should be confirmed by additional studies.

TI  - Abdominal Aortic Diameter and Vascular Atherosclerosis: The Multi-Ethnic
      Study of Atherosclerosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into early mechanisms of aortic widening, we
      examined associations between the diameter of the abdominal aorta (AD) and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and biomarkers, as well as
      measures of subclinical atherosclerosis, in a multi-ethnic population.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort METHODS: A total of 1926 participants (mean
      age 62, 50% women) underwent chest and abdomen scanning by computed
      tomography, ultrasound of the carotid arteries, and CVD risk factor
      assessment. AD was measured 5 cm above and at the bifurcation. RESULTS: In
      a model containing traditional CVD risk factors, biomarkers and ethnicity,
      only age (standardized beta = 0.97), male sex (beta = 1.88), body surface
      area (standardized beta = 0.92), current smoking (beta = 0.42), D-dimer
      levels (beta = 0.19) and hypertension (beta = 0.53) were independently and
      significantly associated with increasing AD (in mm) at the bifurcation;
      use of cholesterol-lowering medications predicted smaller AD (beta =
      -0.70) (P &lt; 0.01 for all). These findings were similar for AD 5 cm above
      the bifurcation with one exception: compared to Caucasian-Americans,
      Americans of Chinese, African and Hispanic descent had significantly
      smaller AD 5 cm above the bifurcation (beta's = -0.59, -0.49, and -0.52,
      respectively, all P &lt; 0.01), whereas AD at the bifurcation did not differ
      by ethnicity. Physical activity, alcohol consumption, diabetes and levels
      of IL-6, CRP and homocysteine were not independently associated with AD.
      Higher aortic and coronary artery calcium burden, but not common carotid
      artery intima-media thickness, were independently, but modestly (beta =
      0.11 to 0.19), associated with larger AD. CONCLUSIONS: Incremental
      widening of the aortic diameter shared some, but not all, risk factors for
      occlusive vascular disease.

TI  - Posttranscriptional silencing of effector cytokine mRNA underlies the
      anergic phenotype of self-reactive T cells.
PG  - 50-60
AB  - Self-reactive T cell clones that escape negative selection are either
      deleted or rendered functionally unresponsive (anergic), thus preventing
      them from propagating host tissue damage. By using an in vivo model, we
      investigated molecular mechanisms for T cell tolerance, finding that
      despite a characteristic inability to generate effector cytokine proteins,
      self-reactive T cells express large amounts of cytokine mRNAs. This
      disconnect between cytokine message and protein was not observed in T
      cells mounting productive responses to foreign antigens but, instead, was
      seen only in those responding to self, where the block in protein
      translation was shown to involve conserved AU-rich elements within
      cytokine 3'UTRs. These studies reveal that translation of abundant
      cytokine mRNAs is limited in self-reactive T cells and, thus, identify
      posttranscriptional silencing of antigen-driven gene expression as a key
      mechanism underlying the anergic phenotype of self-reactive T cells.

TI  - Signaling via the RIP2 adaptor protein in central nervous
      system-infiltrating dendritic cells promotes inflammation and
      autoimmunity.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - Peripheral peptidolgycan (PGN) is present within antigen-presenting cells
      in the central nervous system (CNS) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients,
      possibly playing a role in neuroinflammation. Accordingly, PGN is linked
      with disease progression in the animal model of MS, experimental
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but the role of specific PGN-sensing
      proteins is unknown. Here we report that the progression of EAE was
      dependent on the intracellular PGN sensors NOD1 and NOD2 and their common
      downstream adaptor molecule, receptor interacting protein 2 (RIP2; also
      known as RIPK2 and RICK). We found that RIP2, but not toll-like receptor 2
      (TLR2), played a critical role in the activation of CNS-infiltrating
      dendritic cells. Our results suggest that PGN in the CNS is involved in
      the pathogenesis of EAE through the activation of infiltrating dendritic
      cells via NOD1-, NOD2-, and RIP2-mediated pathways.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes among Stroke Patients Receiving Tissue Plasminogen
      Activator Therapy Beyond the 3-hour Time Window.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tissue plasminogen activator therapy (t-PA) is associated with
      improved neurologic outcomes and reduced disability from ischemic stroke.
      The current guidelines stipulate that patients receive t-PA within 3 hours
      of symptom onset. However, actual practice patterns vary, and little is
      known about patient outcomes when t-PA is received outside of the
      recommended time window. METHODS: We examined mean length of hospital
      stay, t-PA-related complications, and in-hospital death by time of t-PA
      administration in North Carolina Stroke Care Collaborative (NCSCC)
      patients. The NCSCC includes 53 hospitals that enroll patients presenting
      with stroke-like symptoms. Of 40,907 patients enrolled between January
      2005 and February 2010, 1070 (2.6%) received t-PA. Of these, 88.2%
      received t-PA within 3 hours of symptom onset (&quot;early&quot;) and 30.3% received
      t-PA between 3 and 6 hours after symptom onset (&quot;late&quot;). RESULTS:
      Unadjusted mean length of stay (days) was longer among early patients (5.0
      days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-5.3) than late patients (3.6 days;
      95% CI, 3.1-4.2). t-PA-related complications were similar among early
      (7.0%; 55/781) and late patients (6.7%; 7/102; P = .89). The proportion of
      in-hospital deaths was similar among late (10.5%) and early patients
      (12.0%). We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios
      (ORs) and 95% CIs for the associations between late t-PA status and
      patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In models controlling for age, race, sex,
      arrival mode, and ambulatory status on admission, late t-PA was not
      associated with increased odds of complications or in-hospital deaths (OR,
      0.89; 95% CI, 0.49-1.62). The risks and benefits of expansion of the t-PA
      time window in stroke patients merit further investigation.

TI  - The role of Toll-like receptor mediated signalling in the pathogenesis of
      multiple myeloma.
AB  - Toll-like receptors are critical structures in sensing the invading
      pathogens via conserved moieties termed pathogen associated molecular
      patterns and in directing the innate and adaptive immune responses.
      Studies have shown that Toll-like receptors are not limited to normal
      immune cells but are expressed on tumour cells as well, including those of
      lymphoid neoplasms particularly B-cell malignancies, multiple myeloma and
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Neoplastic plasma cells in multiple myeloma
      usually show a different pattern of Toll-like receptor expression compared
      to normal B cells. These receptors on multiple myeloma cells, have been
      indicated to have a role in their proliferation, differentiation and
      survival, probably through induction of autocrine IL-6 secretion, and in
      their immunomodulatory functions. Moreover, it is speculated that these
      molecules may contribute to osteolytic lesions through activation of
      osteoclasts, and to angiogenesis through induction of pro-angiogenic
      factors. Knowledge on Toll-like receptor signalling in the biology of
      malignant plasma cells or their cellular microenvironment may give new
      insights into pathogenesis of multiple myeloma and may open new avenues
      for the therapy of this disease.

TI  - Aortic valve repair with ascending aortic aneurysms: associated lesions
      and adjunctive techniques.
AB  - Objective: Patients with supracoronary ascending aortic aneurysms can have
      aortic insufficiency (AI) due to dilatation of the sinotubular junction
      and/or associated cusp pathology. The incidence and types of cusp lesions
      as well as the effect of AI severity and cusp repair techniques on outcome
      in this patient population is not well defined. Methods: Since 1996, 55
      patients (mean age: 65+/-13 years, 17 bicuspid valves) presented with
      supracoronary ascending aortic aneurysms and AI that was mild/moderate in
      27 (49%) and severe in 28 (51%). Associated pathology included cusp
      prolapse in 18 (33%), cusp restriction in nine (16%) and both in three
      (5%). All patients underwent aortic replacement and remodeling of the
      sinotubular junction. Adjunctive techniques included subcommissural
      annuloplasty in 38(69%) and cusp repair in 28 (51%). Results: AI severity
      was not significantly associated with the presence of cusp pathology
      (p=0.35). Cusp disease was present in 100% of bicuspid aortic valves
      compared with only 34% of trileaflet valves (p&lt;0.001). There was no
      hospital mortality and overall survival was 94+/-4% and 75+/-10%,
      respectively, at 5 and 7 years. Freedom from re-operation was 100% at 7
      years and freedom from recurrent AI (&gt;2+) was 87+/-7% at 5 years. Neither
      the presence of preoperative severe AI, nor the need for cusp repair was
      predictive of late outcome. Conclusions: Cusp pathology is frequently
      encountered in patients with ascending aortic dilatation and AI. Severe AI
      is not a contraindication to valve-preserving surgery, but careful
      identification and repair of cusp pathology, in addition to sinotubular
      junction reduction, is critical for durable, long-term outcome.

TI  - Aortic root enlargement does not increase the surgical risk and short-term
      patient outcome?
AB  - Objective: To analyze the short-term outcome of aortic root enlargement
      (ARE) using death and adverse events as end points. Methods: From January
      1999 through December 2009, 3339 patients were subjected to aortic valve
      replacement (AVR). A total of 678 were considered to have small aortic
      roots (SARs) in which an aortic prosthesis size 21mm or smaller was
      implanted. ARE using a bovine pericardial patch was performed in another
      218 patients, who constitute the study population. This comprised 174
      females (79.8%); the mean age was 69.4+/-13.4 years (8-87, median 74
      years), the body surface area (BSA) was 1.59+/-0.15m(2) and the body mass
      index (BMI) 25.77+/-3.16kgm(-2), and 192 (88.5%) were in New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) II-III. Preoperative echocardiography revealed
      significant left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in 17 patients (8%), a mean
      aortic valve area of 0.57+/-0.27cm(2), and a mean gradient of
      62.51+/-21.25mmHg. A septal myectomy was performed in 129 subjects
      (59.2%), and other associated procedures, mostly coronary artery bypass
      grafting (CABG), in 60 (27.5%). Bioprostheses were implanted in 161
      patients (73.9%). The mean valve size was 21.9+/-1.0 (21-25). The mean
      extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and aortic clamping times were
      82.8+/-19.8min and 56.8+/-12.5min, respectively. Results: Hospital
      mortality was 0.9% (n=2) for ARE as compared with 0.6% (n=4) for the SAR
      group (p=0.8). Inotropic support was required in only 13 (5.9%) patients
      and the first 24-h chest drainage was 336.2+/-202ml. Other complications
      included pacemaker implantation (7.8%), acute renal failure (10.6%),
      respiratory (4.1%), and CVA/transient ischemic attack (CVA/TIA) (3.2%).
      Postoperative echocardiographic evaluation showed a significant decrease
      in peak and mean aortic gradients (23.7+/-9.5 and 14+/-6.2mmHg,
      respectively, p&lt;0.0001). The mean indexed effective orifice area (iEOA)
      was 0.92+/-0.01cm(2)m(-2) (vs 0.84+/-0.07cm(2)m(-2), in SAR, p&lt;0.0001).
      Only 11% of patients (n=24) with ARE exhibited moderate patient-prosthesis
      mismatch (PPM) and none had severe PPM. Mean hospital stay was 9.7+/-9.29
      days (median 7 days). Conclusions: With the growing number of patients
      with degenerative aortic valve pathology, mainly an older population,
      sometimes with calcified and fragile aortic wall, the issue of dealing
      with an SAR poses the dilemma of whether to implant a smaller prosthesis
      and admit some degree of PPM, or to enlarge the aortic root. This study
      demonstrates that the latter can be done in a safe and reproducible
      manner.

TI  - Microbial community analysis of an aerobic nitrifying-denitrifying MBR
      treating ABS resin wastewater.
AB  - A two-stage aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR) system for treating
      acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) resin wastewater was carried out in
      this study to evaluate the system performance on nitrification. The
      results showed that nitrification of the aerobic MBR system was
      significant and the highest TKN removal of approximately 90% was obtained
      at hydraulic retention time (HRT) 18h. In addition, the result of nitrogen
      mass balance revealed that the percentage of TN removal due to
      denitrification was in the range of 8.7-19.8%. Microbial community
      analysis based on 16s rDNA molecular approach indicated that the dominant
      ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) group in the system was a beta-class
      ammonia oxidizer which was identified as uncultured sludge bacterium
      (AF234732). A heterotrophic aerobic denitrifier identified as Thauera
      mechernichensis was found in the system. The results indicated that a sole
      aerobic MBR system for simultaneous removals of carbon and nitrogen can be
      designed and operated for neglect with an anaerobic unit.

TI  - Apoptosis and oncogenesis: give and take in the BCL-2 family.
PG  - 12-20
AB  - The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis constitutes one of the main
      safeguards against tumorigenesis. The BCL-2 family includes the central
      players of this pathway that regulate cell fate through the control of
      mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and important
      progress has been made in understanding the dynamic interactions between
      pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. In particular, recent
      studies have delineated a stepwise model for the induction of MOMP. BCL-2
      proteins are often dysregulated in cancer, leading to increased survival
      of abnormal cells; however, recent studies have paradoxically shown that
      apoptosis induction can under some circumstances drive tumor formation,
      perhaps by inducing compensatory proliferation under conditions of
      cellular stress. These observations underline the complexity of BCL-2
      protein function in oncogenesis.

TI  - Molecular resolution of the B cell landscape.
AB  - The progression of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the B lymphocyte
      lineage requires that uncommitted progenitors successfully negotiate the
      transition from multipotency to unipotency, including the loss of
      self-renewal potential. Previous work identified essential transcription
      factors that mediate B lineage development. Major advances build on this
      knowledge and reveal coordinated changes in gene expression occurring
      within single cells at sequential stages in the B cell differentiation
      pathway. Recent studies on epigenetic mechanisms also provide a framework
      within which transcription factor activity, chromatin modifications, and
      gene expression patterns can be viewed at hierarchical levels to link
      genotype and phenotype.

TI  - Time series fMRI measures detect changes in pontine raphe following acute
      tryptophan depletion.
PG  - 112-21
AB  - Serotonin is synthesized from its precursor, tryptophan, by brainstem
      raphe neurons and their synaptic terminals in limbic regions. The omission
      of tryptophan from an Acute Tryptophan Depletion (ATD) diet transiently
      diminishes serotonin synthesis, alters raphe activity, and mimics symptoms
      of depression. Raphe functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) poses
      challenges using signal-averaging analyses. Time-series properties of fMRI
      blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals may hold promise, so we
      analyzed raphe signals for changes with the ATD diet. Eleven remitted
      (previously depressed) patients were awake with eyes-closed during
      seven-minute resting scans with 0.5s(-1) sampling. BOLD signal time-series
      data were frequency-filtered using wavelet transforms, yielding three
      octave-width frequency bands from 0.25 to 0.03s(-1) and an unbounded band
      below 0.03s(-1). Spectral power, reflecting signal information, increased
      in pontine raphe at high frequencies (0.25 to 0.125s(-1)) during ATD
      (compared to control, balanced, diet, P&lt;0.004) but was unchanged at other
      frequencies. Functional connectivity, the correlation between time-series
      data from pairs of regions, weakened between pontine raphe and anterior
      thalamus at low frequencies during ATD (P&lt;0.05). This preliminarily
      supports using fMRI time-series features to assess pontine raphe function.
      Whether, and how, high frequency activity oscillations interfere with low
      frequency signaling requires further study.

TI  - MAO A VNTR polymorphism and amygdala volume in healthy subjects.
PG  - 87-91
AB  - The X-linked Monoamine Oxidase A (MAO A) gene presents a well known
      functional polymorphism consisting of a variable number of tandem repeats
      (VNTR) (long and short variants) previously associated with altered neural
      function of the amygdala. Using automatic subcortical segmentation
      (Freesurfer), we investigated whether amygdala volume could be influenced
      by this genotype. We studied 109 healthy subjects (age range 18-80years;
      59 male and 50 female), 74 carrying the MAO A High-activity allele and 35
      the MAO A Low-activity allele. No significant effect of the MAO A
      polymorphism or interaction effect between polymorphismxgender was found
      on amygdalar volume. Thus, our findings suggest that the reported impact
      of the MAO A polymorphism on amygdala function is not coupled with
      consistent volumetric changes in healthy subjects. Future studies are
      needed to investigate whether the association between volume of the
      amygdala and the MAO A VNTR polymorphism is influenced by
      social/psychological variables, such as impulsivity, trauma history and
      cigarette smoking behaviour, not taken into account in this work.

TI  - A percutaneous aortic device for cerebral embolic protection during
      cardiovascular intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Embolic stroke is a major cause of morbidity in aortic and
      cardiac interventional procedures. Although cerebral embolic protection
      devices have been developed for carotid interventions and for open heart
      surgery, a percutaneous device for cerebral embolic protection during
      aortic and cardiac interventions would be desirable. METHODS: The Embrella
      Embolic Deflector (Embrella Cardiovascular Inc, Wayne, Pa) is a
      percutaneously placed embolic protection device, inserted by a 6F access
      in the pig's right forelimb, and deployed in the aorta, covering the
      brachiocephalic vessel origins. The device functions by deflecting embolic
      debris downstream in the aortic circulation. A swine model (n = 3) was
      developed for testing the deployment, retrieval, and efficacy of the
      device using a carotid filtration circuit for collection of emboli. Human
      atheromatous material was prepared as embolization particles with
      diameters between 150 and 600 mum. Deflection efficiency of the device was
      calculated by comparing numbers of embolic particles in the carotid
      circulation during protected and unprotected injections. RESULTS: The
      device was reliably deployed, positioned, and retrieved (n = 24). There
      was no significant drop in blood pressure across the membrane of the
      device to suggest reduction of cerebral blood flow. The device did not
      become occluded by embolic debris despite an embolic load many times that
      encountered in the clinical situation. Particles entering the carotid
      circulation after aortic injection of emboli were reduced from 19% of
      total (unprotected) to 1.3% (protected, P &lt; .0001), with 98.7% of all
      injected particles being deflected downstream. There was no evidence of
      arterial injury related to the device found at necropsy. CONCLUSION: The
      Embrella Embolic Deflector performs safely and reliably in the swine model
      of human atheroembolism. It effectively deflects almost all emboli
      downstream, away from the carotid circulation. The deflector shows promise
      as an aortic embolic protection device and merits further investigation.

TI  - The effects of operative indication and urgency of intervention on patient
      outcomes after thoracic aortic endografting.
AB  - BACKGROUND:: Endovascular repair for complex thoracic aortic pathology has
      emerged over the past decade as an alternative to open surgical repair.
      Reports suggest lower morbidity and mortality rates associated with
      endovascular interventions. The purpose of this report was to analyze a
      large single institution experience in endovascular thoracic aortic repair
      based on clinical presentation as well as within and outside specific
      instructions for use. METHODS:: Records of all patients undergoing
      thoracic aortic endografting at our institution were retrospectively
      reviewed for demographics, interventional indications and acuity,
      operative details, and clinical outcomes. Study outcomes were analyzed by
      clinical presentation (urgent/emergent vs elective) and aneurysm
      morphology that was within and outside specific instructions for use as
      recommended by the manufacturer. RESULTS:: Between March 2006 and October
      2009, 96 patients underwent thoracic endografting for aneurysm (n = 43),
      transection (n = 7), penetrating ulcer (n = 11), dissection (n = 19; acute
      = 9, chronic = 10), pseudoaneurysm (n = 11), or miscellaneous indications
      (n = 5). Endografting was performed with various endografts (Gore TAG: 59;
      Medtrontic Talent: 26; Zenith-TX2: 7; Combination: 4.Involvement of the
      arch (n = 42, 43.75%) was treated with subclavian artery coverage without
      revascularization in 13 (13.5%), debranching in 20 (20.8%), and
      fenestration/stenting in 9 (9.38%). Involvement of the visceral vessels (n
      = 24, 25%) was treated with debranching in 15 (15.6%) or
      fenestration/stenting in 9 (9.4%). Patients had a mean follow-up of 11.5
      +/- 10.96 (range: 0-38) months. Overall mortality was 6.25% (n = 6). Mean
      intensive care unit stay was 6.26 +/- 8.55 (range: 1-63, median: 4) days,
      and hospital stay was 9.97 +/- 10.31 (range: 1-65, median: 65) days. Major
      complications were infrequent and included: spinal cord ischemia (n = 6,
      6.25%), stroke (n = 6, 6.25%), myocardial infarction (n = 3, 3.15%), renal
      failure (n = 6, 6.25%), and wound complications (n = 9, 9.38%).
      Reoperation was required in 13 (13.54%), with early intervention in 2
      (2.1%). The vast majority of patients were discharged directly to home (n
      = 66, 68.8%). There were no significant differences between death (1/49
      [2%] vs 5/47 [10.6%], P = .07), stroke (3/49 [6%] vs 3/47 [6%], P = 1.0),
      or spinal cord ischemia (3/49 [6%] vs 3/47 [6%], P = 1.0) when comparing
      urgent/emergent presentation to elective cases, respectively. However,
      there were significant differences in death (6/58 [10.5%] vs 0/38 [0%], P
      = .04) and spinal cord ischemia (6/58 [10.5%] vs 0/38 [0%], P = .04) but
      not stroke (5/58 [8.8%] vs 1/38 [2.5%], P = .24] when procedures were
      performed outside the specific instructions for use. CONCLUSIONS:: Results
      of this single-institution report suggest that endovascular thoracic
      aortic repair is a safe and effective treatment option for a variety of
      thoracic pathology including both elective and emergent cases. However,
      off-label usage of the devices is associated with a significantly higher
      risk of mortality and spinal cord ischemia, but the risk still appears
      acceptable given the majority of cases were emergent.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus subsp. anaerobius isolates from different countries
      are clonal in nature.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus subsp. anaerobius, a microaerophilic,
      catalase-negative bacteria, is the etiological agent of abscess disease, a
      specific chronic condition of sheep and goats, characterized by the
      formation of necrotic lesions that are typically located in superficial
      lymph nodes. In this study, molecular analysis including pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and accessory
      gene regulator (agr) typing was carried out on 94 S. aureus subsp.
      anaerobius strains isolated in different countries (79 were isolated from
      35 outbreaks of the disease in Spain from 1981 to 2009, 9 were isolated in
      Italy, 3 in Denmark and 3 in Sudan). All of the 94 S. aureus subsp.
      anaerobius isolates examined belonged to one PFGE type, within which four
      minority subtypes were identified. Representative isolates of all PFGE
      subtypes as well of all countries belonged to the same sequence type (ST),
      ST1464, which was a singleton, and to the agr type II. Our results support
      the view that abscess disease is caused by a single bacterial clone
      worldwide. This bacterium has existed for at least a century and, thus,
      has undergone long-term small ruminant host restriction.

TI  - Multi-System Verification of Registrations for Image-Guided Radiotherapy
      in Clinical Trials.
AB  - PURPOSE: To provide quantitative information on the image registration
      differences from multiple systems for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT)
      credentialing and margin reduction in clinical trials. METHODS AND
      MATERIALS: Images and IGRT shift results from three different treatment
      systems (Tomotherapy Hi-Art, Elekta Synergy, Varian Trilogy) have been
      sent from various institutions to the Image-Guided Therapy QA Center (ITC)
      for evaluation for the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials.
      Nine patient datasets (five head-and-neck and four prostate) were included
      in the comparison, with each patient having 1-4 daily individual IGRT
      studies. In all cases, daily shifts were re-calculated by re-registration
      of the planning CT with the daily IGRT data using three independent
      software systems (MIMvista, FocalSim, VelocityAI). Automatic fusion was
      used in all calculations. The results were compared with those submitted
      from institutions. Similar regions of interest (ROIs) and same initial
      positions were used in registrations for inter-system comparison.
      Different slice spacings for CBCT sampling and different ROIs for
      registration were used in some cases to observe the variation of
      registration due to these factors. RESULTS: For the 54 comparisons with
      head-and-neck datasets, the absolute values of differences of the
      registration results between different systems were 2.6 +/- 2.1 mm (mean
      +/- SD; range 0.1-8.6 mm, left-right [LR]), 1.7 +/- 1.3 mm (0.0-4.9 mm,
      superior-inferior [SI]), and 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm (0.1-4.0 mm,
      anterior-posterior [AP]). For the 66 comparisons in prostate cases, the
      differences were 1.1 +/- 1.0 mm (0.0-4.6 mm, LR), 2.1 +/- 1.7 mm (0.0-6.6
      mm, SI), and 2.0 +/- 1.8 mm (0.1-6.9 mm, AP). The differences caused by
      the slice spacing variation were relatively small, and the different ROI
      selections in FocalSim and MIMvista also had limited impact. CONCLUSION:
      The extent of differences was reported when different systems were used
      for image registration. Careful examination and quality assurance of the
      image registration process are crucial before considering margin reduction
      using IGRT in clinical trials.

TI  - Dedicated Linear Accelerator Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia: A
      Single-Center Experience in 179 Patients with Varied Dose Prescriptions
      and Treatment Plans.
AB  - PURPOSE: Dedicated linear accelerator radiosurgery (D-LINAC) has become an
      important treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Although the use of
      gamma knife continues to be established, few large series exist using
      D-LINAC. The authors describe their results, comparing the effects of
      varied target and dose regimens. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between August
      1995 and January 2008, 179 patients were treated with D-LINAC
      radiosurgery. Ten patients (5.58%) had no clinical follow-up. The median
      age was 74.0 years (range, 32-90 years). A total of 39 patients had
      secondary or atypical pain, and 130 had idiopathic TN. Initially, 28
      patients received doses between 70 and 85 Gy, with the 30% isodose line
      (IDL) touching the brainstem. Then, using 90 Gy, 82 consecutive patients
      were treated with a 30% IDL and 59 patients with a 50% IDL tangential to
      the pons. RESULTS: Of 169 patients, 134 (79.3%) experienced significant
      relief at a mean of 28.8 months (range, 5-142 months). Average time to
      relief was 1.92 months (range, immediate to 6 months). A total of 31
      patients (19.0%) had recurrent pain at 13.5 months. Of 87 patients with
      idiopathic TN without prior procedures, 79 (90.8%) had initial relief.
      Among 28 patients treated with 70 Gy and 30% IDL, 18 patients (64.3%) had
      significant relief, and 10 (35.7%) had numbness. Of the patients with 90
      Gy and 30% IDL at the brainstem, 59 (79.0%) had significant relief and
      48.9% had numbness. Among 59 consecutive patients with similar dose but
      the 50% isodoseline at the brainstem, 49 patients (88.0%) had
      excellent/good relief. Numbness, averaging 2.49 on a subjective scale of 1
      to 5, was experienced by 49.7% of the patients, CONCLUSIONS: Increased
      radiation dose and volume of brainstem irradiation may improve clinical
      outcomes with the trade-off of trigeminal dysfunction. Further study of
      the implications of dose and target are needed to optimize outcomes and to
      minimize complications.

TI  - Investigations on the prevalence and potential pathogenicity of intestinal
      trichomonads in pigs using in situ hybridization.
AB  - In pigs, three different trichomonad species (Tritrichomonas foetus,
      Tetratrichomonas buttreyi and Tritrichomonas rotunda) have been described
      as commensals in the large intestine. The aim of this study was to gain
      further knowledge on the prevalence and pathogenicity of trichomonads in
      pigs by using a morphology-based approach. Chromogenic in situ
      hybridization (ISH) is a technique which allows direct localization of the
      protozoa in the intestinal tissue and correlation of the infection with
      pathologic changes. In the present study paraffin-wax embedded colon and
      ileum samples of 192 pigs were analyzed with this method. Using a probe
      specific for all known members of the order Trichomonadida (OT) 100 of the
      192 pigs were tested positive. Thereof, about 10% showed moderate to
      high-grade parasitic load with trichomonads invading the lamina propria.
      Partial 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of six of those animals showed a
      100% sequence identity with T. foetus sequences. The majority of these
      animals were also tested positive for other enteropathogenic agents, such
      as Brachyspira sp., Lawsonia intracellularis, Escherichia coli, and
      porcine circovirus type 2. All OT-positive samples were further examined
      with another probe complementary to all known Tritrichomonas species
      sequences including T. foetus, T. augusta, T. mobilensis and T.
      nonconforma resulting in only 48 positives. These results suggest that T.
      foetus may not only be considered as an intestinal commensal but rather a
      facultative pathogen of pigs with a tendency for tissue invasion in the
      presence of other agents. Furthermore, the existence of other - yet to be
      identified - trichomonad species in the colon of pigs was shown.

TI  - Heterogeneous photo-Fenton decolorization of methylene blue over
      LiFe(WO(4))(2) catalyst.
PG  - 1979-84
AB  - Heterogeneous photo-Fenton process using LiFe(WO(4))(2) as catalyst was
      studied to degrade Methylene blue (MB) dye in aqueous solution. The
      results indicated that LiFe(WO(4))(2) could effectively catalyze the
      decolorization of MB in the presence of UV light and H(2)O(2). The effects
      of different parameters such as amounts of catalyst, H(2)O(2)
      concentration, initial pH of the dye solution, initial dye concentration
      and UV light intensity on the decolorization efficiency of the process
      were investigated. It was found that LiFe(WO(4))(2) possessed a wide
      applicable pH range. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to
      investigate the transformation between Fe(III) and Fe(II). It was also
      observed that catalytic behavior could be reproduced in consecutive
      experiments without a considerable drop in the process efficiency.

TI  - Recovery of struvite from animal wastewater and its nutrient leaching loss
      in soil.
PG  - 2026-30
AB  - Contaminants in swine wastewater were recovered in the form of struvite, a
      crystal of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP), using a newly designed
      process, and the leaching loss of MAP in soil was examined. The continuous
      flow process was operated under optimal conditions: 1.0 molar ratio of
      magnesium (Mg) addition with respect to orthophosphate (OP) and an
      aeration rate of 0.73L/Lmin. Five treatments were performed with three
      replications for soil pH and nutrient leaching loss tests. It was found
      that 93% of the OP in the swine wastewater was crystallized, and the MAP
      crystal formation was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning
      electron microscope (SEM) analyses. The analyses revealed that the pattern
      of pH change and N leaching losses for MAP-treated soil were remarkably
      different from those for fused super phosphate (FSP)-urea-treated soils.
      The pH levels for the control and FSP-urea-treated soils after a five-week
      experiment were unchanged or slightly decreased, whereas an increase in pH
      was observed in the MAP-treated soils. Leaching loss of N was higher in
      FSP-urea treatments, with MAP treatments showing N losses of only 1.93 and
      2.05%, respectively, while FSP-urea treatments showed N losses of 7.82 and
      6.47%, respectively, during the same period. Phosphate (P) leaching was
      very slow in both MAP- and FSP-treated groups.

TI  - Adsorption-desorption properties and characterization of crosslinked
      Konjac glucomannan-graft-polyacrylamide-co-sodium xanthate.
PG  - 1681-6
AB  - A new flocculant, based on Konjac-graft-poly (acrylamide)-co-sodium
      xanthate (CKAX), was synthesized in aqueous solution using epichlorohydrin
      (ECH) as the cross-linker and ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as the
      initiator. X-ray diffraction indicated the existence of strong interaction
      between KGM and reactant, including intermolecular and intramolecular
      hydrogen bonds. Microscopy images exhibited the appropriate pore size and
      distribution, which might be related to a higher capacity of flocculation
      and adsorption. Thermo gravimetric analysis showed that the synthetic
      polymer could improve the thermo-stability of the natural polysaccharides,
      and there was a positive correlation between polymer residual weight and
      flocculation. The adsorption and desorption properties for copper ions
      indicated that the adsorption rate could be described by a
      pseudo-second-order rate model, and the Freundlich model provides the best
      fit for the resulting adsorption isotherm. The flocculant can be
      regenerated in HNO(3) solution.

TI  - Therapeutic hypothermia attenuates acute lung injury in paraquat
      intoxication in rats.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Paraquat intoxication induces acute lung injury and
      numerous fatalities have been reported. The mechanism of toxic effect of
      paraquat is oxidative injury and inflammation. Therapeutic hypothermia has
      been known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study
      was designed to evaluate the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on paraquat
      intoxication. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given 50mg/kg of
      paraquat intraperitoneally and divided into the normothermia (36-38
      degrees C) group and the hypothermia (30-32 degrees C) group after 1h of
      paraquat administration. The hypothermia group underwent 2h of hypothermia
      followed by 2h of rewarming. In the survival study, mortality was observed
      for 24h after paraquat administration. An in the second experiment, lung
      tissues and plasma were harvested at 6h after paraquat administration.
      RESULTS: The 12h survival rate was significantly higher in the hypothermia
      group than in the normothermia group (100% vs. 50%, p&lt;0.05), but survival
      rates for 24h were not different. Acute lung injury score was lower in the
      hypothermia group than in the normothermia group (p&lt;0.05).
      Thmalondialdehyde contents of lung tissues, plasma interleukin-6 and
      nitrite/nitrate concentrations were significantly decreased in the HT
      group compared to the NT group (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Therapeutic
      hypothermia delayed early mortality and attenuated acute lung injury in
      paraquat intoxication.

TI  - Complications in Transpalatal Distraction Osteogenesis: A Retrospective
      Clinical Study.
AB  - PURPOSE:: Transpalatal distraction osteogenesis is a bone-borne technique
      to expand the maxilla and has become a routine method in treating patients
      with transverse maxillary hypoplasia. Limited reports concerning treatment
      difficulties have been published. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate and categorize the short- and middle-term incidence of peri-
      and postoperative difficulties (categorized by the classification of Paley
      in problems, obstacles, and complications). The signs of adverse dental
      and periodontal effects were established at least 1 year after removal of
      the distractor. PATIENTS AND METHODS:: A total of 73 patients (27 male, 46
      female; mean age: 28 years; range: 9-59) that underwent bone-borne SARPE
      in 3 centers were retrospectively investigated. Clinical follow-up was
      performed in 63 patients after an average period of 23.9 months (range:
      6-63 months). RESULTS:: Twenty-seven problems (mainly appliance related),
      10 obstacles (appliance-related and asymmetric maxillary expansion), and 1
      complication (premature loss of the TPD-module, due to lack of space, in a
      cleft patient) occurred. Clinical examination showed minimal periodontal
      damage (gingival recession on 15 sites and pocket depths 4-5 mm in 11
      sites). In 28.6% of the incisors radiographic signs of external apical
      root resorption were seen. CONCLUSION:: Bone-borne SARPE is a reliable
      technique with predictable outcomes. These results suggest that bone-borne
      SARPE is associated with a low incidence of dental and periodontal damage.
      Nevertheless, further research, preferably in randomized controlled
      design, is needed to evaluate the long-term effects and stability.

AB  - Workshops are an important part of the IFPA annual meeting. At IFPA
      Meeting 2010 diverse topics were discussed in twelve themed workshops, six
      of which are summarized in this report. 1. The placental pathology
      workshop focused on clinical correlates of placenta accreta/percreta. 2.
      Mechanisms of regulation of trophoblast invasion and spiral artery
      remodeling were discussed in the trophoblast invasion workshop. 3. The
      fetal sex and intrauterine stress workshop explored recent work on
      placental sex differences and discussed them in the context of whether
      boys live dangerously in the womb.4. The workshop on parasites addressed
      inflammatory responses as a sign of interaction between placental tissue
      and parasites. 5. The decidua and embryonic/fetal loss workshop focused on
      key regulatory mediators in the decidua, embryo and fetus and how
      alterations in expression may contribute to different diseases and adverse
      conditions of pregnancy. 6. The trophoblast differentiation and
      syncytialisation workshop addressed the regulation of villous
      cytotrophoblast differentiation and how variations may lead to placental
      dysfunction and pregnancy complications.

TI  - Tailoring nanostructured solid-lipid carriers for time-controlled
      intracellular siRNA kinetics to sustain RNAi-mediated chemosensitization.
PG  - 2662-72
AB  - Use of siRNA for silencing major oncogenic/chemoresistance targets such as
      survivin has strong potential for cancer therapy. However, a key clinical
      limitation is their short action, preventing them from sustaining their
      therapeutic RNA-interference activity for optimal chemosensitization. This
      issue is tackled from the perspective of intracellular siRNA kinetics
      using a novel lipid-based &quot;nanostructured siRNA carrier&quot; (NSC), which
      incorporates variable amount of oil phase into the solid-lipid matrix to
      modify its siRNA release behaviors. We demonstrate that by manipulating
      the degradation responses of NSC device to lysosomal enzyme, tailoring of
      intracellular siRNA kinetics is achievable. A tailored NSC design
      delivering survivin-siRNA can extend the survivin knockdown period to 9
      days, translating into steady, effective in vitro and in vivo
      chemosensitization of prostate cancer to docetaxel for over a week. All in
      all, this new NSC design provides a convenient mean to set up a clinically
      more appealing weekly or longer dosing cycle for siRNA therapy, which
      addresses a significant unmet need for prostate cancer treatment and is
      potentially useful for other chronic disease conditions as well.

TI  - Activated factor XI and tissue factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease: Links with inflammation and thrombin generation.
PG  - 242-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased cardiovascular mortality and risk of venous
      thromboembolism are serious extra-pulmonary complications of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Previously, circulating active
      tissue factor (TF) and factor XIa (FXIa) have been reported to be
      associated with acute coronary syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To measure plasma
      FXIa and active TF, prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2), and markers of
      systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6],
      tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha] and matrix metalloproteinase 9
      [MMP-9]) in 60 patients with documented stable COPD free of previous
      thromboembolic events. METHODS: In-house clotting assays using inhibitory
      monoclonal antibodies against FXIa and TF. RESULTS: FXIa was detected in 9
      (15%) and TF activity in 7 (11.7%) COPD patients. Subjects positive for
      FXIa and/or TF (n=10; 16.7%) had higher F1.2 (median [interquartile
      range], 398 [216] vs 192 [42] pM, p&lt;0.000001), fibrinogen (5.58 [2.01] vs
      3.97 [2.47] g/L, p=0.0007), CRP (14.75 [1.20] vs 1.88 [2.95] mg/L,
      p&lt;0.000001), IL-6 (8.14 [4.74] vs 2.45 [2.24] pg/mL, p=0.00002), and right
      ventricular systolic pressure (47 [15] vs 38 [12] mmHg, p=0.023), and
      lower vital capacity (66 [15] vs 80 [17] % predicted, p=0.04) than COPD
      patients without detectable FXIa and TF. COPD severity was not associated
      with the presence of circulating FXIa and active TF. CONCLUSIONS: This is
      the first study to show that active FXIa and TF are present in stable COPD
      patients, who exhibit enhanced systemic inflammation and thrombin
      generation. Our findings suggest a new prothrombotic mechanism which might

TI  - Tongue necrosis and systemic vascular amyloidosis.
AB  - Tongue necrosis is a rare but dramatic clinical finding, which is most
      often related to infection, trauma, malignancy, or vasculitis. We describe
      an extremely unusual case in which systemic amyloid deposition in small
      arteries caused by senile systemic amyloidosis was associated with
      necrosis of the tongue as well as necrosis of portions of the bowel. To
      our knowledge, this is the first report of ischemic tongue necrosis
      resulting from vascular amyloidosis.

TI  - Expression of Pirh2, a p27(Kip1) ubiquitin ligase, in hepatocellular
      carcinoma: correlation with p27(Kip1) and cell proliferation.
AB  - p53-Induced ring-H2 protein (Pirh2), a recently identified
      ubiquitin-protein ligase, interacts with p27(Kip1) to promote
      ubiquitination of p27(Kip1) independently of p53. High Pirh2 and low
      p27(Kip1) immunoreactivity are associated with a poor prognosis in several
      cancers, including resistant phenotypes. In the present study, we
      investigated the role of Pirh2 and p27(Kip1) in human hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) progression. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on
      formalin-fixed paraffin sections of 87 specimens. Statistical analysis
      showed that expression of Pirh2 was negatively related to p27(Kip1)
      expression (r = 0.787; P &lt; .05), and Pirh2 expression correlated
      significantly with histologic grade (P &lt; .001), venous invasion (P =
      .004), tumor size (P = .024), and the presence of multiple tumor-bearing
      lymph nodes (P = .017), whereas p27(Kip1) expression correlated
      significantly with histologic grade (P &lt; .001), venous invasion (P =
      .048), and cirrhosis (P = .028). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the survival
      curves of low versus high expressers of Pirh2 and p27(Kip1) showed
      significant separation (P &lt; .01). Molecular interaction could be
      demonstrated between Pirh2 and p27(Kip1) in three HCC cell lines. In
      vitro, following release of two HCC cell lines from serum starvation, the
      expression of Pirh2 was upregulated, whereas p27(Kip1) was downregulated.
      Our results suggest that Pirh2 mediates the degradation of p27(Kip1) and
      participates in cell proliferation in human HCC. These findings provide a
      rational framework for further development of Pirh2 inhibitors as a novel
      class of anti-tumor agents.

TI  - TAKEDA-143242 Increased Survival Via Reduced Cytokines in Porcine
      Peritonitis.
AB  - TAKEDA-143242 (TAK-242) is a small molecule shown to inhibit
      lipopolysaccharide-induced intracellular signaling and inflammation. In
      vitro studies demonstrated that TAK-242 can prevent release of TNF-alpha,
      IL-1beta, and IL-6 from activated macrophages of several species,
      including pigs. This study tested the hypothesis that TAK-242 would
      protect pigs from lethal gram-negative peritonitis via an anti-cytokine
      mechanism. A validated model of porcine gram-negative peritonitis, which
      employs chronically inplantated cardiac transducers and aortic and
      pulmonary artery catheters, was used. Pigs were pretreated with TAK-242 or
      its vehicle via a blinding procedure prior to intraperitoneal implantation
      of an LD(90) dose of E. coli 0111:B4 in a fibrin clot. Ten pigs were
      treated with TAK-242 and nine with its vehicle. All ten TAK-242 treated
      pigs survived, while three of the nine vehicle treated pigs survived (P =
      0.01 chi(2) test). Pulmonary artery pressure increased markedly in vehicle
      pigs, and this elevation was significantly (two-way ANOVA) obviated in
      TAK-242 treated group. Circulating levels of cytokines in vehicle treated
      pigs showed increased expression (3930 +/- 1770 at 1 h, 1007 +/- 400
      TNF-alpha at 2 h; 719 +/- 308 of IL-1beta at 2-6 h; 33000 +/- 1000 of IL-6
      at 2-4 h [pg/mL, mean +/- SEM]). Peak circulating levels of these
      cytokines were significantly reduced by pretreatment with TAK-242 (&lt;25
      pg/mL TNF-alpha ; &lt;100 pg/mL IL-1beta; 0-1700 pg/mL IL-6, peak values).
      This study found that pretreatment with TAK-242 yielded significantly
      positive survival benefit in a lethal sepsis model that was associated
      with improved cardiovascular status and suppressed cytokine release.

TI  - The mass transfer kinetics in columns packed with Halo-ES shell particles.
PG  - 907-21
AB  - The average mesopore size of the new Halo-ES-Peptide shell particles is
      160 A, markedly larger than that of the classical Halo shell particles (90
      A). We found that this change causes a considerable decrease of the film
      mass transfer resistance measured for columns packed with these particles.
      We analyze data obtained by systematic measurements of the C term of the
      van Deemter equation for the peptide beta-lipotropin (MW = 769 Da), the
      protein insulin (MW = 5800 Da), and a series of non-retained polystyrene
      standards (MW = 6400 and 13,200). The improvement in column performance is
      explained by an increase of the fraction of the external surface area of
      the shell that allows the entrance of the sample molecules inside the
      particle. The fraction of the shell surface accessible to a probe controls
      the rate of its external film mass transfer, i.e. its rate of transfer
      between the interstitial and the stagnant eluent. Although measurable, the
      increase in sample diffusivity through the porous shells does not account
      for the better performance of Halo-ES-peptide columns. Furthermore, the
      analysis of the HETPs data of small molecules (uracil, acetophenone,
      toluene, and naphthalene, MW&lt; 150) reveals that the eddy diffusion (A)
      term of these new columns is 25% lower than that of the classical Halo
      columns. This result is consistent with the impact of intra-particle
      diffusivity on the eddy diffusion mechanism in packed columns. As shell
      diffusivity increases, so does the rate of transfer of sample molecules
      between the eluent stream-paths flowing through the packed particles and
      across the column diameter. Dispersion through short-range inter-channel
      and trans-column eddies is reduced.

TI  - Coupling asymmetric flow-field flow fractionation and fluorescence
      parallel factor analysis reveals stratification of dissolved organic
      matter in a drinking water reservoir.
AB  - Using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and fluorescence
      parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), we showed physicochemical properties
      of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Beaver Lake
      Reservoir (Lowell, AR) were stratified by depth. Sampling was performed at
      a drinking water intake structure from May to July 2010 at three depths
      (3-, 10-, and 18-m) below the water surface. AF4-fractograms showed that
      the CDOM had diffusion coefficient peak maximums between 3.5 and
      2.8x10(-6)cm(2)s(-1), which corresponded to a molecular weight range of
      680-1950Da and a size of 1.6-2.5nm. Fluorescence excitation-emission
      matrices of whole water samples and AF4-generated fractions were
      decomposed with a PARAFAC model into five principal components. For the
      whole water samples, the average total maximum fluorescence was highest
      for the 10-m depth samples and lowest (about 40% less) for 18-m depth
      samples. While humic-like fluorophores comprised the majority of the total
      fluorescence at each depth, a protein-like fluorophore was in the least
      abundance at the 10-m depth, indicating stratification of both total
      fluorescence and the type of fluorophores. The results present a powerful
      approach to investigate CDOM properties and can be extended to investigate
      CDOM reactivity, with particular applications in areas such as
      disinfection byproduct formation and control and evaluating changes in
      drinking water source quality driven by climate change.

TI  - Polymorphisms in ARMS2 (LOC387715) and LOXL1 Genes in the Japanese With
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
PG  - 550-556.e1
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether polymorphisms in the ARMS2 (LOC387715) gene
      and the lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) gene are associated with age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD) in Japanese patients. DESIGN: Clinically
      relevant laboratory investigation. METHODS: Forty-one unrelated Japanese
      subjects with dry AMD, 50 subjects with exudative (wet) AMD, and 60
      subjects with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) were studied. The
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), p.Ala69Ser of the ARMS2 gene and
      p.Arg141Leu of the LOXL1 gene, were amplified by polymerase chain
      reaction, directly sequenced, and genotyped. RESULTS: For the ARMS2 gene,
      the genotype frequency of the p.Ala69Ser single nucleotide polymorphism in
      eyes with dry AMD was not significantly different from that in the
      controls (P = .04), but the frequency was significantly higher in the
      exudative AMD group (P = 3.1 x 10(-8)) and PCV group (P = 6.9 x 10(-3)).
      For the LOXL1 gene, the genotype frequency of the p.Arg141Leu single
      nucleotide polymorphism was not statistically higher in the dry AMD and
      PCV groups than in the control group (dry AMD, P = .05; PCV, P = .16), but
      was statistically higher in the exudative AMD group (P = 6.8 x 10(-3)).
      Regression analyses showed significant associations between the ARMS2 gene
      and LOXL1 gene in patients with exudative AMD. CONCLUSIONS: The p.Ala69Ser
      polymorphism of the ARMS2 gene is strongly associated with exudative AMD
      and PCV and is associated marginally with dry AMD. The polymorphisms in
      the LOXL1 gene did not predispose the individual to dry AMD and PCV. These
      findings suggest that there is a significant association between the ARMS2
      gene and LOXL1 gene in exudative AMD.

TI  - Interocular Symmetry in Peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness
      Measured With the Cirrus HD-OCT in Healthy Eyes.
PG  - 514-521.e1
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the cutoffs for the interocular difference in
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measured with Cirrus HD-OCT
      (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc) in normal eyes. DESIGN: Observational, clinical
      study. METHODS: Scans were acquired at 7 academic glaucoma clinics from
      both eyes of 284 normal subjects using the Optic Disc Cube 200 x 200
      protocol. The interocular differences in RNFL thickness were calculated,
      and normal ranges of interocular differences were determined as the 2.5th
      and 97.5th percentiles. RESULTS: The average RNFL in the right eye was
      0.52 mum thicker than in the left eye; the difference was marginally
      significant (P = .049). The temporal, nasal, and inferior quadrants had
      significantly thicker RNFL in the right eye, whereas the left eye showed
      thicker RNFL in the superior quadrant. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentile
      interocular difference tolerance limits for average RNFL thickness were
      -7.9 mum and 8.8 mum, respectively. Although the difference in average
      RNFL thickness correlated with differences in axial length, disc area,
      cup-to-disc ratio, and vertical cup-to-disc ratio, only differences in
      axial length (beta = -0.21; P &lt; .001) and disc area (beta = 0.17; P &lt;
      .001) were associated with an interocular difference of average RNFL
      thickness after adjustment for each other. The interocular difference
      remained stable despite significant decrease in RNFL thickness with aging.
      CONCLUSIONS: An interocular difference in average RNFL thickness exceeding
      9 mum when measured with the Cirrus HD-OCT in normal eyes may be
      considered statistically significant asymmetry and may be indicative of
      early glaucomatous damage.

TI  - Herpes viruses in transplant recipients: HSV, VZV, human herpes viruses,
      and EBV.
PG  - 171-91
AB  - The herpes viruses are responsible for a wide range of diseases in
      patients following transplant, resulting from direct viral effects and
      indirect effects, including tumor promotion. Effective treatments and
      prophylaxis exist for the neurotropic herpes viruses HSV-1, HSV-2,
      varicella zoster virus, and possibly HHV-6. Antivirals seem to be less
      effective at prevention of the tumor-promoting effects of Epstein-Barr
      virus and HHV-8. Reduction in immunosuppression is the cornerstone to
      treatment of many diseases associated with herpes virus infections.

TI  - Feasibility of Catheter Ablation of Mitral Annular Flutter in Patients
      with Prior Mitral Valve Surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitral annular flutter (MAF) may occur after ablation of
      atrial fibrillation in patients with prior mitral valve (MV) replacement
      or repair. Percutaneous catheter ablation may be challenging due to the
      presence of surgical scar and a prosthetic MV. OBJECTIVE: We examined the
      feasibility of and outcome following mitral isthmus ablation in patients
      with prior MV surgery. METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive patients (18 males,
      age 61 +/-10 yrs) with history of MV surgery (9 replacement, 12 repair
      with annuloplasty ring) underwent catheter ablation of clinical (n=17) or
      easily inducible (n=4) MAF (Group I). Patients were matched for age,
      gender, and ejection fraction with 21 patients undergoing MAF ablation
      without prior MV surgery (group II). Irrigated ablation was delivered
      endocardially in a linear fashion from the MV to the left inferior and/or
      to the right superior pulmonary vein and when required, epicardially
      inside the coronary sinus. Isolation of all pulmonary veins was also
      performed. RESULTS: There was no difference in termination of tachycardia
      during ablation (Group I vs Group II; 86% vs. 71%; P=0.454), achieving
      mitral isthmus block (71% vs 71%;P=1.000) or need for epicardial ablation
      (43% vs. 62%; p=0.354) between groups. No complications occurred in either
      group. After a mean follow up of 7+/-4 months, 15 (71%) patients in Group
      I and 14 (67%) in group II had no recurrence of atrial arrhythmias.
      CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous mitral isthmus ablation is feasible and safe in
      patients with prior MV replacement or repair, and has comparable outcomes
      to patients without prior MV surgery.

TI  - Management and Outcomes of Cardiac Tamponade during Atrial Fibrillation
      Ablation in the Presence of Therapeutic Anticoagulation with Warfarin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac tamponade (CT) is a possible complication of
      radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF).
      Although the incidence of CT is not higher when RFCA is performed with a
      therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR), outcomes of CT are
      unclear. OBJECTIVE: We compared outcomes among patients with and without a
      therapeutic INR who developed CT as a complication of RFCA of AF. METHODS:
      The subjects of this retrospective study were 40 consecutive patients who
      developed CT during RFCA of AF at 3 centers. We divided the patients into
      2 groups: RFCA performed with INR&lt;2 (group 1) and INR&gt;/=2 (group 2). There
      were 23 patients in group 1 and 17 patients in group 2. RESULTS: Baseline
      clinical and procedure characteristics were not different between the 2
      groups. Heparin was reversed by protamine in 83% and 94% of patients
      (p=0.37) and warfarin was reversed by fresh frozen plasma or factor VIIa
      in 17% and 35% of patients (p=0.27) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. All
      patients were successfully treated by percutaneous drainage and none
      required surgical intervention. There were no significant differences in
      the amount of initial pericardial drainage (523+/-349 vs. 409+/-157 ml,
      p=0.22) or the duration of drainage (p = 0.14) between the 2 groups. All
      patients survived to hospital discharge. Median length of hospital stay
      was 2 days longer in group 1 (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: Cardiac tamponade is
      not more severe or difficult to manage in the presence of therapeutic
      anticoagulation with warfarin in patients undergoing RFCA of AF.

TI  - Evidence for the presence of a critical disulfide bond in the mouse
      EP3gamma receptor.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - To determine the contribution of cysteines to the function of the mouse
      E-prostanoid subtype 3 gamma (mEP3gamma), we tested a series of
      cysteine-to-alanine mutants. Two of these mutants, C107A and C184A, showed
      no agonist-dependent activation in a cell-based reporter assay for
      mEP3gamma, whereas none of the other cysteine-to-alanine mutations
      disrupted mEP3gamma signal transduction. Total cell membranes prepared
      from HEK293 cells transfected with mEP3gamma C107A or C184A had no
      detectable radioligand binding. Other mutant mEP3gamma receptors had
      radioligand affinities and receptor densities similar to wild-type.
      Cell-surface ELISA against the N-terminal HA-tag of C107A and C184A
      demonstrated 40% and 47% reductions respectively in receptor protein
      expression at the cell surface, and no radioligand binding was detected as
      assessed by intact cell radioligand binding experiments. These data
      suggest a key role for C107 and C184 in both receptor structure/stability
      and function and is consistent with the presence of a conserved disulfide
      bond between C107 and C184 in mouse EP3 that is required for normal
      receptor expression and function. Our results also indicate that if a
      second disulfide bond is present in the native receptor it is
      non-essential for receptor assembly or function.

PG  - 59-72
AB  - Bioactive lipids derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute an
      important set of lipid mediators with diverse homeostatic and
      pathophysiological activities. The role of bioactive lipids in
      inflammation, active resolution of inflammation, reproduction,
      cardiovascular biology, chronic diseases such as cancer and metabolic
      disorders is an active area of research. Other than the few clinically
      used eicosanoids such as prostaglandin F(2)alpha, prostacyclin, and
      prostaglandin E(2), little is known about the stability of a majority of
      the bioactive lipids in aqueous solutions despite their extensive use
      under in vitro experimental conditions. The present study evaluated the
      stability of eicosanoids and docosanoids as well as their parent
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in tissue culture media with respect to
      incubation time, temperature, and composition of the media using multiple
      reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-MS. The results provide a comprehensive and
      valuable data set on the stability of these bioactive lipid mediators to
      guide in vitro experimentation.

TI  - An APPL1/Akt signaling complex regulates dendritic spine and synapse
      formation in hippocampal neurons.
AB  - The formation and plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses, which are
      poorly understood on a molecular level, are critical for cognitive
      functions, such as learning and memory. The adaptor protein containing a
      PH domain, PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif (APPL1) is emerging as a
      critical regulator of various cellular processes in non-neuronal cells,
      but its function in the nervous system is not well understood. Here, we
      show that APPL1 localizes to dendritic spines and synapses and regulates
      the development of these structures in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of
      endogenous APPL1 using siRNA led to a significant decrease in the number
      of spines as well as synapses and this defect could be rescued by
      expression of siRNA-resistant APPL1. Expression of exogenous APPL1
      increased the spine and synaptic density and the amount of surface
      GluR1-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid
      receptors (AMPARs). Deletion of the C-terminal phosphotyrosine binding
      domain of APPL1, which binds the serine/threonine kinase Akt, resulted in
      a significant decrease in the spine and synaptic density, suggesting a
      role for Akt in regulating the development of these structures. Consistent
      with this, knockdown of Akt with siRNA or expression of dominant negative
      Akt led to a dramatic decrease in spine and synapse formation. In
      addition, APPL1 increased the amount of active Akt in spines and synapses
      and the effects of APPL1 on these structures were dependent on Akt,
      indicating that Akt is an effector of APPL1 in the regulation of these
      processes. Moreover, APPL1 signaling modulates spine and synapse formation
      through p21-activated kinase (PAK). Thus, our results indicate that APPL1
      signaling through Akt and PAK is critical for spine and synaptic
      development and point to a role for APPL1 and its effectors in regulating
      cognitive function.

TI  - Calcitriol counteracts endothelial cell pro-inflammatory processes in a
      chronic kidney disease-like environment.
AB  - In advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypocalcemia, high levels of
      advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      coexist and are considered to play a role in the development of chronic
      vasculopathies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of
      a CKD-like environment on cultured endothelial cell (EC) functions and to
      assess the impact of calcitriol on the expression of parameters such as
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), receptor of AGEs (RAGE),
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). Human
      umbilical vein cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown in medium
      containing low Ca(2+) concentration stimulated with AGE-HSA and PTH and
      treated with calcitriol for additional incubation. mRNA expression was
      established by reverse transcriptase-PCR, protein expression by Western
      blot analysis, IL-6 secretion by ELISA, NOS activity by conversion of
      [(14)C]arginine to [(14)C]citrulline and DNA-binding activity of
      NFkappaB-p65 assayed colorimetrically in nuclear extracts. The CKD-like
      environment characterized by the association of low Ca(2+) and high levels
      of AGEs and PTH, depressed eNOS system activity and enhanced RAGE and IL-6
      expression/secretion. DNA-binding activity of nuclear NFkappaB-p65 was
      increased and the expression of IkappaBalpha decreased. Addition of
      calcitriol normalized the expression, secretion and activity of eNOS, RAGE
      and IL-6. The enhanced NFkappaB activity was also counteracted probably
      due to the increased IkappaBalpha expression. The effect of CKD-like
      environment on EC may partly explain the increased vasculopathies in CKD
      patients, in contrast to calcitriol, which suggests a vascular protective
      action.

TI  - 15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) induces Cox-2 expression in human
      osteosarcoma cells through MAPK and EGFR activation involving reactive
      oxygen species.
AB  - Prostaglandins (PGs), important modulators in bone biology, may also
      contribute to tumor formation and progression in human osteosarcoma.
      15-Deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), a metabolite of PGD(2) and
      PPARgamma-ligand, exerts a panel of biological activities via
      receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. As inducible
      cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is a candidate inflammatory marker in human
      osteosarcoma and a rate-limiting enzyme in PG biosynthesis, this study
      aimed at investigating intracellular redox status and signaling cascades
      leading to Cox-2 induction in human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. 15d-PGJ(2)
      induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that in turn may
      lead to upregulation of Cox-2 via two different routes in a
      PPARgamma-independent manner. First, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK directly
      enhances Cox-2 expression by promoting mRNA stability. Second, 15d-PGJ(2)
      induces activation of epidermal growth factor receptors and downstream
      activation of Cox-2 via phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. Glutathione
      precursor molecules reversed enhanced ROS levels and Cox-2 expression.
      Functional activity of Cox-2 expression was tested by measurement of
      PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha). The synthetic compound 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ(2)
      lacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone
      ring did not exhibit the cellular responses observed with 15d-PGJ(2). We
      conclude that the electrophilic carbon atom of 15d-PGJ(2) is responsible
      for alterations in intracellular redox status and Cox-2 expression.

TI  - Validation of a high-sensitivity assay for C-reactive protein in human
      saliva.
AB  - This study aimed to validate a high-sensitivity assay for C-reactive
      protein (CRP) in saliva as an alternative medium to study inflammation in
      large epidemiological cohorts and young people. We measured CRP in saliva
      and serum in 61 (29.5% males) healthy adult volunteers. We found a
      moderate-to-strong association between CRP measured in saliva and in serum
      (r=.72, p&lt;.001). In agreement with the non-steroidal structure and the
      high molecular weight of CRP, we observed a low saliva-to-serum CRP ratio
      (1:1633.64). Furthermore, a dichotomous index of salivary CRP, equivalent
      to a clinically relevant serum CRP cut-off (3mg/l), was associated to
      known correlates of systemic inflammation (IL-6, BMI and smoking).
      Finally, we showed that CRP in saliva is stable at room temperature up to
      8h after collection. Our study provides initial evidence suggesting that
      non-invasive assessment of CRP in saliva allows valid prediction of serum
      CRP. Salivary CRP may thus facilitate and promote research exploring the
      correlates of low-grade inflammation in epidemiological studies and makes
      it feasible to expand psychoneuroimmunology research to pediatric
      populations.

TI  - Towards high-yield production of pharmaceutical proteins with plant cell
      suspension cultures.
AB  - &quot;Molecular farming&quot; in plants with significant advantages in cost and
      safety is touted as a promising platform for the production of complex
      pharmaceutical proteins. While whole-plant produced biopharmaceuticals
      account for a significant portion of the preclinical and clinical
      pipeline, plant cell suspension culture, which integrates the merits of
      whole-plant systems with those of microbial fermentation, is emerging as a
      more compliant alternative &quot;factory&quot;. However, low protein productivity
      remains a major obstacle that limits extensive commercialization of plant
      cell bioproduction platform. This review highlights the advantages and
      recent progress in plant cell culture technology and outlines viable
      strategies at both the biological and process engineering levels for
      advancing the economic feasibility of plant cell-based protein production.
      Approaches to overcome and solve the associated challenges of this culture
      system that include non-mammalian glycosylation and genetic instability
      will also be discussed.

TI  - Brain tissue energy dependence of CaM kinase IV cascade activation during
      hypoxia in the cerebral cortex of newborn piglets.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - The present study aims to investigate the dependence of CaM kinase IV
      cascade activation during hypoxia and tests the hypothesis that
      hypoxia-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CaM and CaM kinase IV,
      activation of CaM kinase IV and phosphorylation of CREB protein during
      hypoxia increases as a function of increase in cerebral tissue hypoxia as
      measured by decrease in tissue ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr). 3-5 days old
      newborn piglets were divided into normoxic (Nx, FiO(2) of 0.21 for 1h) and
      hypoxic (Hx, FiO(2) of 0.07 for 1h) groups. Cerebral tissue hypoxia was
      documented by determining the levels of high energy phosphates ATP and
      phosphocreatine (PCr). Cerebral cortical neuronal nuclei were isolated and
      purified, and tyrosine phosphorylation of calmodulin (Tyr(99)), the
      activator of CaM kinase IV, and CaM kinase IV determined by Western blot
      using anti-phospho-(pTyr(99))-calmodulin, anti-pTyrosine and anti-CaM
      kinase IV antibodies. The activity of CaM kinase IV and its consequence
      the phosphorylation of CREB protein at Ser(133) were determined. The
      levels of ATP (mumole/g brain) ranged from 3.48 to 5.28 in Nx, and 0.41 to
      2.26 in Hx. The levels of PCr (mumole/g brain) ranged from 2.46 to 3.91 in
      Nx and 0.72 to 1.20 in Hx. The pTyr(99) calmodulin (ODxmm(2)) ranged from
      20.35 to 54.47.60 in Nx, and 84.52 to 181.42 in Hx (r(2)=0.5309 vs ATP and
      r(2)=0.6899 vs PCr). Expression of tyrosine phosphorylated CaM kinase IV
      ranged from 32.86 to 82.46 in Nx and 96.70 to 131.62 in Hx (r(2)=0.5132 vs
      ATP and r(2)=0.4335 vs PCr). The activity of CaM kinase IV (pmole/mg
      protein/min) ranged from 1263 to 3448 in Nx and 3767 to 6633 in Hx
      (r(2)=0.7113 vs ATP and r(2)=0.6182 vs PCr). The expression of p-CREB at
      Ser(133) ranged from 44.26 to 70.28 in Nx and 82.70 to 182.86 in Hx
      (r(2)=0.6621 vs ATP and r(2)=0.5485 vs PCr). The data show that hypoxia
      results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of calmodulin (Tyr(99)),
      increased tyrosine phosphorylation of CaM kinase IV, increased activity of
      CaM kinase IV and increased phosphorylation of CREB at Ser(133) as an
      inverse function of cerebral concentration of high energy phosphates, ATP
      and PCr. We conclude that the hypoxia-induced increased activation of CaM
      kinase IV cascade increases with the increase in the degree of cerebral
      tissue hypoxia as measured by cerebral tissue high energy phosphates in a
      curvilinear manner. The tyrosine kinases (Src kinase and EGFR kinase)
      mediated activation of CaM kinase IV cascade potentially results in
      increased CREB phosphorylation that triggers transcription of proapoptotic
      proteins during hypoxia.

TI  - Disease specificity and pathologic progression of tau pathology in
      brainstem nuclei of Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear
      palsy.
PG  - 122-6
AB  - Previous studies have shown tau pathology in the inferior colliculus (IC)
      and superior colliculus (SC) in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it has
      not been compared to other tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear
      palsy (PSP), or characterized with respect to progression of tau pathology
      in AD. The main purpose of this study was to investigate frequency,
      neuroanatomical selectivity and disease specificity of tau pathology in
      visual and auditory nuclei (SC and lateral geniculate body (LGB); IC and
      medial geniculate body (MGB), respectively). We measured phospho-tau
      burden with immunohistochemistry and image analysis in 26 cases of AD, 37
      PSP and 11 normal controls. Tau burden was also assessed in two unrelated
      brainstem nuclei (substantia nigra (SN) and pedunculopontine nucleus
      (PPN)) of the same cases. We found tau burden to be greater in the SC of
      PSP compared to AD and controls. Conversely, tau burden was greater in the
      IC of AD compared to PSP and controls. The MGB and LGB had sparse tau
      pathology in both AD and PSP. This disease selectivity parallels known
      deficits in visual reflexes in PSP and auditory reflexes in AD. Tau burden
      was greater in the SC, IC, and PPN in both PSP and AD compared to
      controls, and greater in the SN in PSP compared to AD and controls.
      Although present at early Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages, the SC, IC,
      PPN and SN did not accumulate tau consistently until later stages. These
      findings support a concept of tau pathology affecting the brainstem at
      mid-to-late stage AD.

TI  - Increasing Hepatic Arteriole Wall Thickness and Decreased Luminal Diameter
      Occur With Increasing Age in Normal Livers.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is no data to suggest that size of bile ducts,
      portal venules and hepatic arterioles varies according to age in the
      normal human liver. We sought to examine whether hepatic arteriolar size,
      wall thickness and luminal diameter change with increasing age. METHODS:
      Histologically normal liver specimens from 90 live and deceased donors
      were separated into three groups of thirty: donor age &lt;30, 31-60 and &gt;60
      years old. Trichrome-stained slides were de-identified and assessed by a
      liver pathologist blinded to donor age. Morphometric measurements were
      taken of the hepatic arteriole, the cross-sectional diameter, and its wall
      thickness. The arteriole was measured at its widest diameter, the
      arteriolar wall at its thickest portion, and the luminal diameter between
      its widest points. RESULTS: There was no difference in number of
      arterioles or bile ducts or in arteriolar cross-sectional diameter among
      the groups and no correlation with age was found. An increasing arteriolar
      wall thickness and a decrease in luminal diameter with advancing age were
      noted; no difference in bile duct size among the groups was found. There
      was a significant difference in wall thickness/total cross-sectional
      diameter with extremes in age (21-30 age group vs. 71-80 age group, p =
      0.0009) with an accompanying significant decrease in luminal
      diameter/cross-sectional diameter between the same groups (p = 0.00002).
      CONCLUSIONS: Increasing hepatic arteriolar wall thickness and decreased
      arteriolar cross-sectional diameter occur with increasing age in the
      normal human liver.

TI  - Maternal exposure to cadmium during gestation perturbs the vascular system
      of the adult rat offspring.
PG  - 137-45
AB  - Several cardiovascular diseases (CVD) observed in adulthood have been
      associated with environmental influences during fetal growth. Here, we
      show that maternal exposure to cadmium, a ubiquitously distributed heavy
      metal and main component of cigarette smoke is able to induce
      cardiovascular morpho-functional changes in the offspring at adult age.
      Heart morphology and vascular reactivity were evaluated in the adult
      offspring of rats exposed to 30ppm of cadmium during pregnancy.
      Echocardiographic examination shows altered heart morphology characterized
      by a concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Also, we observed a reduced
      endothelium-dependent reactivity in isolated aortic rings of adult
      offspring, while endothelium-independent reactivity remained unaltered.
      These effects were associated with an increase of hem-oxygenase 1 (HO-1)
      expression in the aortas of adult offspring. The expression of HO-1 was
      higher in females than males, a finding likely related to the
      sex-dependent expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1
      (VCAM-1), which was lower in the adult female. All these long-term
      consequences were observed along with normal birth weights and absence of
      detectable levels of cadmium in fetal and adult tissues of the offspring.
      In placental tissues however, cadmium levels were detected and correlated
      with increased NF-kappaB expression - a transcription factor sensitive to
      inflammation and oxidative stress - suggesting a placentary mechanism that
      affect genes related to the development of the cardiovascular system. Our
      results provide, for the first time, direct experimental evidence
      supporting that exposure to cadmium during pregnancy reprograms
      cardiovascular development of the offspring which in turn may conduce to a
      long term increased risk of CVD.

      up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA levels in
      glomerular endothelial cells.
AB  - Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the development and
      progression of diabetic nephropathy. There is a growing body of evidence
      that advanced glycation end products (AGE) and inflammation contribute to
      diabetic nephropathy as well. However, the pathophysiological crosstalk
      between the RAS and AGE in inflammatory reactions in glomerular
      endothelial cells (ECs) remains unknown. In this study, we examined
      whether and how irbesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker
      (ARB), inhibited the AGE-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
      (VCAM-1) gene expression in cultured human glomerular ECs. Irbesartan or
      an anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited the AGE-induced increase in
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequently blocked
      up-regulation of VCAM-1 mRNA levels in glomerular ECs. AGE significantly
      stimulated angiotensin II production by glomerular ECs. Furthermore,
      irbesartan completely suppressed up-regulation of VCAM-1 mRNA levels in
      AGE plus angiotensin II-exposed glomerular ECs. Our present data suggest
      that there exists a crosstalk between the RAS and AGE in inflammatory
      reactions in glomerular ECs. Irbesartan may play a protective role against
      diabetic nephropathy by blocking the deleterious effects of AGE-elicited
      angiotensin II and ROS.

TI  - Neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of mollugin via
      up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 in mouse hippocampal and microglial
      cells.
PG  - 226-34
AB  - Mollugin, a bioactive phytochemical isolated from Rubia cordifolia L.
      (Rubiaceae), exhibits antimutagenic activity, antitumor activity,
      antiviral activity, and inhibitory activity in arachidonic acid- and
      collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In this study, we investigated the
      effects of mollugin as a neuroprotective agent in glutamate-induced
      neurotoxicity in the mouse hippocampal HT22 cell line and as an
      anti-inflammatory agent in lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial
      activation in BV2 cells. Mollugin showed potent neuroprotective effects
      against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and reactive oxygen species
      generation in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. In addition, the
      anti-inflammatory effects of mollugin were demonstrated by the suppression
      of pro-inflammatory mediators, including pro-inflammatory enzymes
      (inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2) and cytokines
      (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6). Furthermore, we found
      that the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of mollugin were
      linked to the up-regulation of the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and
      the activity of HO in HT22 and BV2 cells. In addition, the effects of
      mollugin resulted in the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-E2-related
      factor 2 (Nrf2) in HT22 and BV2 cells. Furthermore, mollugin also
      activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway both in
      HT22 and BV2 cells. These results suggest that mollugin may be a promising
      candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases related to
      neuroinflammation.

TI  - Effect of potassium channel opener pinacidil on the contractions elicited
      electrically or by noradrenaline in the human radial artery.
PG  - 266-73
AB  - In order to discover an agent that can prevent spasm of the human radial
      artery, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of the K(+)
      channel opener, pinacidil, on contractions in the radial artery.
      Contractions of the radial artery were evoked by exogenously applied
      noradrenaline or by electrical field stimulation (EFS, 20Hz, neurogenic).
      Pinacidil induced concentration-dependent inhibition of both EFS- and
      noradrenaline-evoked contractions of the radial artery. Glibenclamide, a
      selective blocker of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (Kir6.x containing
      subunit) antagonized in the same manner the pinacidil-induced inhibition
      of neurogenic contractions and contractions evoked by exogenous
      noradrenaline. The inhibition of pinacidil relaxation by
      tetraethylammonium (TEA), a blocker of Ca-sensitive K(+) (K(Ca)) channels,
      was more pronounced in EFS-contracted preparations. A blocker of
      voltage-sensitive K(+) (K(V)) channels, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), inhibited
      pinacidil relaxation only in EFS-contracted preparations. In order to test
      the presence of different K(+) channels, immunohistochemistry of K(+)
      channels expression in the radial artery was performed. The vascular wall
      of the human radial artery showed variable positivity with the following
      applied antibodies: Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kir6.1, and K(Ca)1.1. The antibodies
      against Kv1.6, Kv2.1, and Kir6.2 channel subunits were completely
      negative. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of pinacidil on
      contractions of the human radial artery might be postsynaptic and
      associated with opening of smooth muscle Kir6.1-containing K(ATP)
      channels. TEA- and 4-AP-sensitive K(+) channels may also contribute to
      pinacidil effect in the human radial artery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether thawed plasma
      stored for 5 days at 1-6  masculineC is appropriate for use. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Samples taken from thawed plasma units stored for 5 days at 1-6 
      masculineC were prepared for assays of the levels of factor V, factor
      VIII, and factor X, and for measurements of the activated partial
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT). The results obtained
      were then compared with those from other similar studies. RESULTS: The
      average decreases in percentages of coagulation factors from day 1 to day
      5 were 20% for factor V, 11% for factor X, and 25% for total factor VIII.
      The changes in the range of coagulation factors over the 5-day storage
      period were statistically significant, but the values remained within the
      haemostatic range. The average increases in the levels of PT and aPTT from
      day 1 to day 5 were also not clinically pathological. CONCLUSIONS: Thawed
      fresh-frozen plasma stored for 5 days at 1-6  degrees C can be used in
      different cases of coagulopathy and can be used as an alternative to
      plasma frozen within 24 hours of phlebotomy.

TI  - The use of fresh-frozen bone in oral surgery: a clinical study of 14
      consecutive cases.
PG  - 41-5
LID - 10.2450/2010.0130-09 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although autologous bone is considered the gold standard among
      the grafting materials used in implant therapy, it does have a number of
      drawbacks, in particular morbidity at the site of donation and the limited
      amount of bone available. To overcome these limitations a number of
      alternative bone materials have been employed in the last few years. In
      this study we report the results of the use of homologous fresh-frozen
      bone from a tissue bank in patients undergoing reconstruction of bone
      defects in the oral cavity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between June 2004 and
      October 2008, 14 consecutive patients underwent bone reconstruction with
      fresh-frozen bone from a tissue bank. Four to eight months after surgery,
      implants were placed in the newly formed bone. RESULTS: No problems were
      recorded during the post-operative course. In all cases treatment was
      successful and osteointegrated implants were placed in the newly formed
      bone after 4-8 months. All implants showed good osteointegration (100%
      overall success rate, mean follow-up 20 months), allowing loading with a
      fixed cemented prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the previous
      findings that homologous fresh-frozen bone can be considered a valid
      alternative to autologous bone for the reconstruction of bone defects in
      the oral cavity in patients undergoing implant therapy.

TI  - Adenovirus-mediated sphingomyelin synthase 2 increases atherosclerotic
      lesions in ApoE KO mice.
PG  - 7
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) contributes to de
      novo sphingomyelin (SM) biosynthesis. Its activity is related to SM levels
      in the plasma and the cell membrane. In this study, we investigated the
      possibility of a direct relationship between SMS and atherosclerosis.
      METHODS: The Adenovirus containing SMS2 gene was given into 10-week ApoE
      KO C57BL/6J mice by femoral intravenous injection. In the control group,
      the Adenovirus containing GFP was given. To confirm this model, we took
      both mRNA level examination (RT-PCR) and protein level examination (SMS
      activity assay). RESULT: We generated recombinant adenovirus vectors
      containing either human SMS2 cDNA (AdV-SMS2) or GFP cDNA (AdV-GFP). On day
      six after intravenous infusion of 2 x 1011 particle numbers into
      ten-week-old apoE KO mice, AdV-SMS2 treatment significantly increased
      liver SMS2 mRNA levels and SMS activity (by 2.7-fold, 2.3-fold, p &lt; 0.001,
      respectively), compared to AdV-GFP treated mice. Moreover, plasma total
      cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
      triglyceride (TG), and sphingomyelin (SM) levels were significantly
      increased by 39% (p &lt; 0.05), 42% (p &lt; 0.05), 68% (p &lt; 0.001), and 45% (p &lt;
      0.05), respectively. Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
      phosphatidylcholine (PC), and PC/SM ratio were decreased by 42% (p &lt;
      0.05), 18% (p &lt; 0.05), and 45% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. On day 30, the
      atherosclerotic lesions on the aortic arch of AdV-SMS2 treated mice were
      increased, and the lesion areas on the whole aorta and in the aortic root
      were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the collagen
      content in the aorta root was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results present direct morphological evidence for the
      pro-atherogenic capabilities of SMS2. SMS2 could be a potential target for
      treating atherosclerosis.

PG  - 4
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Complement proteins and activation products have
      been found associated with neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Recently, a C5a receptor antagonist was shown to suppress neuropathology
      in two murine models of AD, Tg2576 and 3xTg. Previously, a genetic
      deficiency of C1q in the Tg2576 mouse model showed an accumulation of
      fibrillar plaques similar to the complement sufficient Tg2576, but
      reactive glia were significantly decreased and neuronal integrity was
      improved suggesting detrimental consequences for complement activation in
      AD. The goal of this study was to define the role of the classical
      complement activation pathway in the progression of pathology in the 3xTg
      mouse that develops tangles in addition to fibrillar plaques (more closely
      reflecting human AD pathology) and to assess the influence of complement
      in a model of AD with a higher level of complement hemolytic activity.
      METHODS: 3xTg mice deficient in C1q (3xTgQ-/-) were generated, and both
      3xTg and 3xTgQ-/- were backcrossed to the BUB mouse strain which has
      higher in vitro hemolytic complement activity. Mice were aged and
      perfused, and brain sections stained for pathological markers or analyzed
      for proinflammatory marker expression. RESULTS: 3xTgQ-/- mice showed
      similar amounts of fibrillar amyloid, reactive glia and
      hyperphosphorylated tau as the C1q-sufficient 3xTg at the ages analyzed.
      However, 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/- on the BUB background developed pathology
      earlier than on the original 3xTg background, although the presence of C1q
      had no effect on neuropathological and pro-inflammatory markers. In
      contrast to that seen in other transgenic models of AD, C1q, C4 and C3
      immunoreactivity was undetectable on the plaques of 3xTg in any
      background, although C3 was associated with reactive astrocytes
      surrounding the plaques. Importantly, properdin a component of the
      alternative complement pathway was associated with plaques in all models.
      CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previously investigated transgenic models of
      AD, development of neuropathology in 3xTg mice, which progresses much
      slower than other murine models, may not be influenced by fibrillar
      amyloid mediated activation of the classical complement pathway,
      suggesting that the alternative complement pathway activation or a
      C3-independent cleavage of C5 could account for the detrimental effects in
      these mice that are prevented by the C5a receptor antagonist. Furthermore,
      the paucity of complement activation may be a factor in the slower
      kinetics of progression of pathology in the 3xTg model of this disease.

TI  - Protective effect of Garcinia against renal oxidative stress and
      biomarkers induced by high fat and sucrose diet.
PG  - 6
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Obesity became major health problem in the world,
      the objective of this work was to examine the effect of high sucrose and
      high fat diet to induce obesity on antioxidant defense system, biochemical
      changes in blood and tissue of control, non treated and treated groups by
      administration of Garcinia cambogia, and explore the mechanisms that link
      obesity with altered renal function METHODS: Rats were fed a standard
      control diet for 12 week (wk) or a diet containing 65% high sucrose (HSD)
      or 35% fat (HFD) for 8 wk and then HFD group divided into two groups for
      the following 4 wks. One group was given Garcinia+HFD, the second only
      high fat, Also the HSD divided into two groups, 1st HSD+Garcinia and 2nd
      HSD. Blood and renal, mesenteric, Perirenal and epididymal adipose tissues
      were collected for biochemical assays. RESULTS: HFD and HSD groups of rats
      showed a significant increase in feed intake, Body weight (BW) and body
      mass index (BMI). Also there were significant increases in weights of
      mesenteric, Perirenal and epididymal adipose tissues in HFD and HSD
      groups.HFD and HSD affect the kidney by increasing serum urea and
      creatinine levels and decreased level of nitric oxide (NO) and increased
      blood glucose, low density lipoproteins (LDL), triacylglycerol (TG), total
      cholesterol (TC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Glucose 6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities were significantly decreased in HFD while
      there were significant increases in HSD and HSD+G groups p &lt;/= 0.05
      compared with control. Moreover, renal catalase activities and MDA levels
      were significantly increased while NO level was lowered. These changes
      improved by Garcinia that decreased the oxidative stress biomarkers and
      increased NO level.There were significant positive correlations among BMI,
      kidney functions (Creatinine and urea), TG and Oxidative markers (renal
      MDA and catalase). CONCLUSIONS: Rats fed a diet with HFD or HSD showed,
      hypertriglyceridemia, increased LDL production, increased oxidative stress
      and renal alteration. Moreover, suggesting association between lipid
      peroxidation, obesity and nephropathy, while Garcinia ameliorated the
      damaging effects of the HFD or HSD and decreased feed intake, MDA level
      and decreased oxidative stress in renal tissues.

TI  - Is public transport a risk factor for acute respiratory infection?
PG  - 16
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between public transport use and acquisition
      of acute respiratory infection (ARI) is not well understood but
      potentially important during epidemics and pandemics. METHODS: A
      case-control study performed during the 2008/09 influenza season. Cases (n
      = 72) consulted a General Practitioner with ARI, and controls with another
      non-respiratory acute condition (n = 66). Data were obtained on bus or
      tram usage in the five days preceding illness onset (cases) or the five
      days before consultation (controls) alongside demographic details.
      Multiple logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the
      association between bus or tram use and ARI, adjusting for potential
      confounders. RESULTS: Recent bus or tram use within five days of symptom
      onset was associated with an almost six-fold increased risk of consulting
      for ARI (adjusted OR = 5.94 95% CI 1.33-26.5). The risk of ARI appeared to
      be modified according to the degree of habitual bus and tram use, but this
      was not statistically significant (1-3 times/week: adjusted OR = 0.54 (95%
      CI 0.15-1.95; &gt;3 times/week: 0.37 (95% CI 0.13-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: We
      found a statistically significant association between ARI and bus or tram
      use in the five days before symptom onset. The risk appeared greatest
      among occasional bus or tram users, but this trend was not statistically
      significant. However, these data are plausible in relation to the greater
      likelihood of developing protective antibodies to common respiratory
      viruses if repeatedly exposed. The findings have differing implications
      for the control of seasonal acute respiratory infections and for pandemic
      influenza.

TI  - Treatment with a neutralizing anti-murine interleukin-17 antibody after
      the onset of coxsackievirus b3-induced viral myocarditis reduces
      myocardium inflammation.
PG  - 17
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Recently, some studies indicate that interleukin
      (IL)-17, known as a T cell (Th17)-derived proinflammatory cytokine, is the
      major mediator of tissue inflammation in inflammatory and autoimmune
      diseases. Viral myocarditis (VMC) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease,
      but the role for IL-17 in VMC is not well defined. RESULTS: Using IL-17
      monoclonal antibody (IL-17mAb)-treated VMC mice, we tested the pathogenic
      role of IL-17 in the development of VMC. VMC mice were treated with
      monoclonal rat anti-murine IL-17 antibody (anti-IL-17) or rat IgG2A
      isotype control or phosphate-buffered solution 3 days after Coxsackievirus
      B3 (CVB3) injection. Normal mice without any manipulation were taken as
      normal control. The survival rates of mice were monitored and heart
      pathology was examined histologically. IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-alpha mRNA of
      the myocardium were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Systemic IL-17,
      IL-6, and TNF-alpha level were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay, and local myocardium IL-17 expression was analyzed using
      immunohistochemical staining. Flow cytometric analysis was used to
      evaluate the frequencies of Th17 subsets in CD4+T cells. Results showed
      that neutralization of IL-17 with anti-IL-17 can ameliorate clinical
      symptoms, defer disease course, decrease serum IL-17 level, without
      declining the IL-17, IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA transcript level and serum
      IL-6, TNF-alpha level. The differentiation and proliferation of the Th17
      cells were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that IL-17 is
      crucially involved in the pathogenesis of murine VMC, IL-17 inhibition
      might ameliorate the myocardium inflammation after the onset of VMC.

TI  - Systematic cross-validation of 454 sequencing and pyrosequencing for the
      exact quantification of DNA methylation patterns with single CpG
      resolution.
PG  - 6
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: New high-throughput sequencing technologies promise
      a very sensitive and high-resolution analysis of DNA methylation patterns
      in quantitative terms. However, a detailed and comprehensive comparison
      with existing validated DNA methylation analysis methods is not yet
      available. Therefore, a systematic cross-validation of 454 sequencing and
      conventional pyrosequencing, both of which offer exact quantification of
      methylation levels with a single CpG dinucleotide resolution, was
      performed. RESULTS: To this end the methylation patterns of 12 loci
      (GSTpi1, p16INK4a, RASSF1A, SOCS1, MAL, hsa-mir-1-1, hsa-mir-9-3,
      hsa-mir-34a, hsa-mir-596, hsa-mir-663, MINT31, and LINE-1) were analyzed
      in ten primary hepatocellular carcinoma specimens. After applying
      stringent quality control criteria, 35749 sequences entered further
      analysis. The methylation level of individual CpG dinucleotides obtained
      by 454 sequencing was systematically compared with the corresponding
      values obtained by conventional pyrosequencing. Statistical analyses
      revealed an excellent concordance of methylation levels for all individual
      CpG dinucleotides under study (r2 = 0.927). CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      confirm that 454 sequencing of bisulfite treated genomic DNA provides
      reliable high quality quantitative methylation data and identify MAL,
      hsa-mir-9-3, hsa-mir-596, and hsa-mir-663 as new targets of aberrant DNA
      methylation in human hepatocelluar carcinoma. In addition, the single
      molecule resolution of 454 sequencing provides unprecedented information
      about the details of DNA methylation pattern heterogeneity in clinical
      samples.

TI  - Immunohistochemical staining of radixin and moesin in prostatic
      adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Some members of the Protein 4.1 superfamily are
      believed to be involved in cell proliferation and growth, or in the
      regulation of these processes. While the expression levels of two members
      of this family, radixin and moesin, have been studied in many tumor types,
      to our knowledge they have not been investigated in prostate cancer.
      METHODS: Tissue microarrays were immunohistochemically stained for either
      radixin or moesin, with the staining intensities subsequently quantified
      and statistically analyzed using One-Way ANOVA or nonparametric equivalent
      with subsequent Student-Newman-Keuls tests for multiple comparisons. There
      were 11 cases of normal donor prostates (NDP), 14 cases of benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 23 cases of high-grade prostatic
      intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), 88 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma
      (PCa), and 25 cases of normal tissue adjacent to adenocarcinoma (NAC)
      analyzed in the microarrays. RESULTS: NDP, BPH, and HGPIN had higher
      absolute staining scores for radixin than PCa and NAC, but with a
      significant difference observed between only HGPIN and PCa (p = &lt; 0.001)
      and HGPIN and NAC (p = 0.001). In the moesin-stained specimens, PCa, NAC,
      HGPIN, and BPH all received absolute higher staining scores than NDP, but
      the differences were not significant. Stage 4 moesin-stained PCa had a
      significantly reduced staining intensity compared to Stage 2 (p = 0.003).
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, these studies represent the first reports
      on the expression profiles of radixin and moesin in prostatic
      adenocarcinoma. The current study has shown that there were statistically
      significant differences observed between HGPIN and PCa and HGPIN and NAC
      in terms of radixin expression. The differences in the moesin profiles by
      tissue type were not statistically significant. Additional larger studies
      with these markers may further elucidate their potential roles in
      prostatic neoplasia progression.

TI  - Global analysis of estrogen receptor beta binding to breast cancer cell
      genome reveals an extensive interplay with estrogen receptor alpha for
      target gene regulation.
PG  - 36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) are
      transcription factors (TFs) that mediate estrogen signaling and define the
      hormone-responsive phenotype of breast cancer (BC). The two receptors can
      be found co-expressed and play specific, often opposite, roles, with
      ERbeta being able to modulate the effects of ERalpha on gene transcription
      and cell proliferation. ERbeta is frequently lost in BC, where its
      presence generally correlates with a better prognosis of the disease. The
      identification of the genomic targets of ERbeta in hormone-responsive BC
      cells is thus a critical step to elucidate the roles of this receptor in
      estrogen signaling and tumor cell biology. RESULTS: Expression of
      full-length ERbeta in hormone-responsive, ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells
      resulted in a marked reduction in cell proliferation in response to
      estrogen and marked effects on the cell transcriptome. By ChIP-Seq we
      identified 9702 ERbeta and 6024 ERalpha binding sites in
      estrogen-stimulated cells, comprising sites occupied by either ERbeta,
      ERalpha or both ER subtypes. A search for TF binding matrices revealed
      that the majority of the binding sites identified comprise one or more
      Estrogen Response Element and the remaining show binding matrixes for
      other TFs known to mediate ER interaction with chromatin by tethering,
      including AP2, E2F and SP1. Of 921 genes differentially regulated by
      estrogen in ERbeta+ vs ERbeta- cells, 424 showed one or more ERbeta site
      within 10 kb. These putative primary ERbeta target genes control cell
      proliferation, death, differentiation, motility and adhesion, signal
      transduction and transcription, key cellular processes that might explain
      the biological and clinical phenotype of tumors expressing this ER
      subtype. ERbeta binding in close proximity of several miRNA genes and in
      the mitochondrial genome, suggests the possible involvement of this
      receptor in small non-coding RNA biogenesis and mitochondrial genome
      functions. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the vast majority of the
      genomic targets of ERbeta can bind also ERalpha, suggesting that the
      overall action of ERbeta on the genome of hormone-responsive BC cells
      depends mainly on the relative concentration of both ERs in the cell.

TI  - Relevance of JAK2V617F positivity to hematological diseases - survey of
      samples from a clinical genetics laboratory.
PG  - 4
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: JAK2V617F is found in the majority of patients with
      Ph- myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and has become a valuable marker
      for diagnosis of MPNs. However, it has also been found in many other
      hematological diseases, and some studies even detected the presence of
      JAK2V617F in normal blood samples. This casts doubt on the primary role of
      JAK2V617F in the pathogenesis of MPNs and its diagnostic value. METHODS:
      In the present study, we analyzed JAK2V617F positivity with 232 normal
      blood samples and 2663 patient blood, bone marrow, and amniotic fluid
      specimens obtained from a clinical genetics laboratory by using a simple
      DNA extraction method and a sensitive nested allele-specific PCR strategy.
      RESULTS: We found JAK2V617F present in the majority (78%) of MPN patients
      and in a small fraction (1.8-8.7%) of patients with other specific
      hematological diseases but not at all in normal healthy donors or patients
      with non-hematological diseases. We also revealed associations of
      JAK2V617F with novel as well as known chromosomal abnormalities.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that JAK2V617F positivity is associated
      with specific hematological malignancies and is an excellent diagnostic
      marker for MPNs. The data also indicate that the nested allele-specific
      PCR method provides clinically relevant information and should be
      conducted for all cases suspected of having MPNs as well as for other
      related diseases.

TI  - Normal social seeking behavior, hypoactivity and reduced exploratory range
      in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome.
PG  - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder
      characterized by severe developmental delay with mental retardation, a
      generally happy disposition, ataxia and characteristic behaviors such as
      inappropriate laughter, social-seeking behavior and hyperactivity. The
      majority of AS cases are due to loss of the maternal copy of the UBE3A
      gene. Maternal Ube3a deficiency (Ube3a m-/p+), as well as complete loss of
      Ube3a expression (Ube3a m-/p-), have been reproduced in the mouse model
      used here. RESULTS: Here we asked if two characteristic AS phenotypes -
      social-seeking behavior and hyperactivity - are reproduced in the Ube3a
      deficient mouse model of AS. We quantified social-seeking behavior as time
      spent in close proximity to a stranger mouse and activity as total time
      spent moving during exploration, movement speed and total length of the
      exploratory path. Mice of all three genotypes (Ube3a m+/p+, Ube3a m-/p+,
      Ube3a m-/p-) were tested and found to spend the same amount of time in
      close proximity to the stranger, indicating that Ube3a deficiency in mice
      does not result in increased social seeking behavior or social
      dis-inhibition. Also, Ube3a deficient mice were hypoactive compared to
      their wild-type littermates as shown by significantly lower levels of
      activity, slower movement velocities, shorter exploratory paths and a
      reduced exploratory range. CONCLUSIONS: Although hyperactivity and
      social-seeking behavior are characteristic phenotypes of Angelman Syndrome
      in humans, the Ube3a deficient mouse model does not reproduce these
      phenotypes in comparison to their wild-type littermates. These phenotypic
      differences may be explained by differences in the size of the genetic
      defect as ~70% of AS patients have a deletion that includes several other
      genes surrounding the UBE3A locus.

TI  - Protocol for Shoulder function training reducing musculoskeletal pain in
      shoulder and neck: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 14
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Neck and shoulder complaints are common among
      employees in sedentary occupations characterized by intensive computer
      use. Such musculoskeletal pain - which is often associated with restricted
      range of motion and loss of muscle strength - is one of the most common
      conditions treated by physical therapists. The exact mechanism of neck
      pain is rarely revealed by clinical examination and the treatment has
      varied from passive rest to active treatments. Active treatments have
      often been divided into either training of the painful area or the
      surrounding musculature avoiding direct training of the painful area. Our
      study investigates the effect of the latter approach. METHODS/DESIGN: A
      randomized controlled trial of 10 weeks duration is currently being
      conducted. Employed office workers with severe neck-shoulder pain are
      randomized to 3 x 20 min shoulder function training with training
      supervision or to a reference group receiving advice to stay physically
      active. Shoulder function training primarily focuses on the serratus
      anterior and lower trapezius muscle with only minimal activation the upper
      trapezius.An announcement was sent to the administrative section of the
      university including jobs characterized by intensive computer work. The
      first 100 positive replies entered the study. Among these inclusion
      criteria were pain intensity in the neck/shoulder of at least 3 on a 0-9
      scale. Exclusion criteria were cardiovascular disease, trauma,
      hypertension, or serious chronic disease. Before and after the
      intervention period the participants replied to a questionnaire about
      musculoskeletal disorders and work disability, and underwent a
      standardized clinical examination of the neck and shoulder girdle.
      Further, on a weekly basis the participants log pain intensity of the neck
      and shoulder during the previous week.The primary outcome measure is pain
      in the neck and shoulders at week 10 based on the weekly pain registration
      and results from the clinical examination. Secondary outcomes are strength
      and work disability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials (NCT):
      NCT01205542.

TI  - Plasma acetate, gluconate and interleukin-6 profiles during and after
      cardiopulmonary bypass: a comparison of Plasma-Lyte 148 with a
      bicarbonate-balanced solution.
PG  - R21
AB  - ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: As even small concentrations of acetate in the
      plasma result in pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic effects, it has been
      removed from renal replacement fluids. However, Plasma-Lyte 148
      (Plasma-Lyte), an electrolyte replacement solution containing acetate plus
      gluconate is a common circuit prime for cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB). No
      published data exist on the peak plasma acetate and gluconate
      concentrations resulting from the use of Plasma-Lyte 148 during CPB.
      METHODS: Thirty adult patients were systematically allocated 1:1 to CPB
      prime with either bicarbonate-balanced fluid (24 mmol/L bicarbonate) or
      Plasma-Lyte 148. Arterial blood acetate, gluconate and interleukin-6
      (IL-6) levels were measured immediately before CPB (T1), three minutes
      after CPB commencement (T2), immediately before CPB separation (T3), and
      four hours post separation (T4). RESULTS: Acetate concentrations (normal
      0.04 to 0.07 mmol/L) became markedly elevated at T2, where the Plasma-Lyte
      group (median 3.69, range (2.46 to 8.55)) exceeded the bicarbonate group
      (0.16 (0.02 to 3.49), P &lt; 0.0005). At T3, levels had declined but the
      differential pattern remained apparent (Plasma-Lyte 0.35 (0.00 to 1.84)
      versus bicarbonate 0.17 (0.00 to 0.81)). Normal circulating acetate
      concentrations were not restored until T4. Similar gluconate concentration
      profiles and inter-group differences were seen, with a slower T3 decay.
      IL-6 increased across CPB, peaking at T4, with no clear difference between
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Use of acetate containing prime solutions result in
      supraphysiological plasma concentrations of acetate. The use of
      acetate-free prime fluid in CPB significantly reduced but did not
      eliminate large acetate surges in cardiac surgical patients. Complete
      elimination of acetate surges would require the use of acetate free bolus
      fluids and cardioplegia solutions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia and New
      Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN12610000267055.

TI  - Low level of physical activity in women with rheumatoid arthritis is
      associated with cardiovascular risk factors but not with body fat mass--a
      cross sectional study.
PG  - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: As many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have increased
      fat mass (FM) and increased frequency of cardiovascular diseases we
      evaluated if total physical activity (MET-hours) had impact on body
      composition and cardiovascular risk factors in women with RA. METHODS:
      Sixty-one out-ward RA women, 60.8 (57.3-64.4) years, answered a
      self-administered questionnaire, to estimate total daily physical activity
      during the previous year. Physical activity level was given as metabolic
      equivalents (MET) x h/day. Diet content was assessed by a food frequency
      questionnaire and body composition by whole-body dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. Blood lipids and antibodies against phosphorylcholine
      (anti-PC) were determined. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of the women had BMI
      &gt; 25, 6% were centrally obese and 80% had FM% &gt; 30%. The median (IQR)
      total physical activity was 40.0 (37.4-47.7), i.e. the same activity level
      as healthy Swedish women in the same age. Total physical activity did not
      significantly correlate with disease activity, BMI or FM%. Disease
      activity, BMI and FM% did not differ between those in the lowest quartile
      of total physical activity and those in the highest quartile. However, the
      women in the lowest quartile of physical activity had lower HDL (p =
      0.05), Apo A1 (p = 0.005) and atheroprotective natural anti-PC (p = 0.016)
      and higher levels of insulin (p = 0.05) and higher frequency of insulin
      resistance than those in the highest quartile. Women in the lowest
      quartile consumed larger quantities of saturated fatty acids than those in
      the highest quartile (p = 0.042), which was associated with high oxidized
      low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). CONCLUSION: This cross sectional study
      demonstrated that RA women with fairly low disease activity, good
      functional capacity, high FM and high frequency of central obesity had the
      same total physical activity level as healthy Swedish women in the same
      age. The amount of total physical activity was not associated with
      functional capacity or body composition. However, low total physical
      activity was associated with dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, low levels
      of atheroprotective anti-PC and consumption of saturated fatty acids,
      which is of interest in the context of increased frequency of
      cardiovascular disease in RA.

TI  - Persistent Tn polyagglutination syndrome during febrile neutropenia: a
      case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 8
AB  - ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Tn polyagglutination syndrome is a rare disorder
      that has been reported on only a few occasions in the literature, and, to
      the best of our knowledge, never before in the context of febrile
      neutropenia. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 26-year-old
      Caucasian woman who presented to our emergency department complaining of a
      persistent fever over the previous three days. She had a history of
      long-standing refractory pancytopenia with multi-lineage dysplasia and
      severe neutropenia, but she had rarely experienced infection. The results
      of a physical examination and multiple laboratory tests were unremarkable.
      While investigating the possible causes of the refractory, long-standing
      pancytopenia, the possibility of a polyagglutinable state was suggested.
      Blood samples were sent to the laboratory for an analysis of mixed-field
      seed lectin agglutination assay. A serum lectin panel confirmed the final
      diagnosis of Tn-activation. CONCLUSIONS: We should include Tn-activation
      in our differential whenever we encounter cases of refractory
      long-standing idiopathic cytopenias and inconclusive bone marrow results
      displaying multi-lineage dysplasia. Novel genetic techniques have recently
      revealed the interesting pathophysiology of this phenomenon. The
      recognition and inclusion of Tn polyagglutination syndrome in our
      differential diagnoses has important clinical implications, given its main
      associated features, such as severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia,
      which are usually linked to a benign clinical course and prognosis.
      Increased awareness of the polyagglutinable disorders will potentially
      decrease the need for invasive and costly medical interventions and also
      raises the need for monitoring of this specific sub-set of patients. In
      addition, the study of the expression and implications of Tn, and other
      similar antigens, offers a fascinating perspective for the study of its
      role in the diagnosis, prognosis and immunotherapy of solid tumors and
      hematological malignancies. The infrequency with which Tn
      polyagglutination syndrome is encountered, its clinical features and its
      pathophysiology make it a formidable diagnostic challenge.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of Ollier disease: Is it all in the genes?
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ollier disease is a rare, non-hereditary disorder which is
      characterized by the presence of multiple enchondromas (ECs), benign
      cartilaginous neoplasms arising within the medulla of the bone, with an
      asymmetric distribution. The risk of malignant transformation towards
      central chondrosarcoma (CS) is increased up to 35%. The aetiology of
      Ollier disease is unknown. METHODS: We undertook genome-wide copy number
      and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array
      on 37 tumours of 28 Ollier patients in combination with expression array
      using Illumina BeadArray v3.0 for 7 ECs of 6 patients. RESULTS:
      Non-recurrent EC specific copy number alterations were found at FAM86D,
      PRKG1 and ANKS1B. LOH with copy number loss of chromosome 6 was found in
      two ECs from two unrelated Ollier patients. One of these patients also had
      LOH at chromosome 3. However, no common genomic alterations were found for
      all ECs. Using an integration approach of SNP and expression array we
      identified loss as well as down regulation of POU5F1 and gain as well as
      up regulation of NIPBL. None of these candidate regions were affected in
      more than two Ollier patients suggesting these changes to be random
      secondary events in EC development. An increased number of genetic
      alterations and LOH were found in Ollier CS which mainly involves
      chromosomes 9p, 6q, 5q and 3p. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first
      genome-wide analysis of the largest international series of Ollier ECs and
      CS reported so far and demonstrate that copy number alterations and LOH
      are rare and non-recurrent in Ollier ECs while secondary CS are
      genetically unstable. One could predict that instead small deletions,
      point mutations or epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the origin of ECs
      of Ollier disease.

TI  - New uses for old drugs: pharmacophore-based screening for the discovery of
      P-glycoprotein inhibitors.
LID - 10.1111/j.1747-0285.2011.01089.x [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the best characterized transporters
      responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype exhibited by
      cancer cells. Therefore, there is widespread interest in elucidating
      whether existing drugs are candidate P-gp substrates or inhibitors. With
      this aim, a pharmacophore model was created based on known P-gp inhibitors
      and it was used to screen a database of existing drugs. The P-gp
      modulatory activity of the best hits was evaluated by several methods such
      as the rhodamine-123 accumulation assay using K562Dox cell line, and a
      P-gp ATPase activity assay. The ability of these compounds to enhance the
      cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was assessed with the sulphorhodamine-B assay.
      Of the twenty-one hit compounds selected in silico, twelve were found to
      significantly increase the intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123, a
      P-gp substrate. In addition, amoxapine and loxapine, two tetracyclic
      antidepressant drugs, were discovered to be potent non-competitive
      inhibitors of P-gp, causing a 3.5-fold decrease in the doxorubicin GI(50)
      in K562Dox cell line. The overall results provide important clues for the
      non-label use of known drugs as inhibitors of P-gp. Potent inhibitors with
      a dibenzoxazepine scaffold emerged from this study and they will be
      further investigated in order to develop new P-gp inhibitors.

TI  - PARP Inhibition Restores Erectile Function by Suppressing Corporal Smooth
      Muscle Apoptosis in Diabetic Rats.
LID - 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02176.x [doi]
AB  - Introduction.  An important mechanism suggested to be responsible for
      diabetes-associated erectile dysfunction (ED) involves increased
      apoptosis, increased collagen deposition, and reduced smooth muscle
      content in the corpus cavernosum. Aim.  To determine whether the
      activation of the pro-apoptotic poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose)
      polymerase (PARP) pathway is involved in the induction of corporal
      apoptosis, and whether the administration of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), a
      specific PARP inhibitor, could ameliorate ED in diabetic rats. Methods. 
      Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8-weeks-old) were randomly divided into three
      groups: age-matched controls (C), diabetic controls (DM), and 3-AB-treated
      diabetic group (DM + 3-AB). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (ip)
      injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Eight weeks after the induction of
      diabetes, DM + 3-AB group treated with 3-AB (30 mg/kg/day, ip) for 4
      weeks. Main Outcome Measures.  At 12 weeks after diabetes induction,
      erectile function was assessed by cavernous nerve stimulation. Penile
      tissue was assessed for apoptosis, Masson's trichrome stain and
      immunohistochemical analysis for smooth muscle alpha actin. Expression of
      poly(ADP-ribose), phospho-protein kinase B (Akt), phospho-Bcl-2-associated
      death promoter (Bad), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated
      X Protein (Bax), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were evaluated by
      Western blot. Caspase-3 activity and malondialdehyde (MDA), adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
      concentrations were also determined. Results.  DM group showed impaired
      erectile function, increased PARP activity and corporal apoptosis, and
      decreased smooth muscle contents. Expression of phospho-Akt, phospho-Bad,
      Bcl-2, and concentrations of ATP and NAD+ were decreased in the DM group,
      whereas concentrations of MDA, expression of Bax, nuclear translocation of
      AIF, and caspase-3 activity were increased. Treatment with 3-AB restored
      erectile function and significantly reversed all molecular and
      histological alterations except for the increased MDA. Conclusion. 
      Over-activation of penile PARP pathway in diabetic rats enhances corporal
      apoptosis via energy depletion, suppression of Akt phosphorylation, and
      activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which results in ED;
      these event could be prevented by treatment with 3-AB. Li WJ, Zhou J, Li

      Index in a Chinese Population-A Pilot Study.

AB  - Introduction.  Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a prevalent problem that
      has been continuously overlooked in mainland China. An assessment
      instrument for FSD is urgently needed. Aim.  To develop and validate the
      Chinese version of the Female Sexual Function Index (CVFSFI) to assess FSD
      in China. Methods.  A total of 328 women (20-65 years old) participated in
      this study. The CVFSFI was developed through the procedures of
      translation, back translation, revision by research team, and pilot study.
      After an interview for clinical diagnosis of FSD based on Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision
      (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, all participants completed the CVFSFI for a
      validation study. Eighty-three women completed CVFSFI again 3-4 weeks
      after the first visit. Test-retest reliability was determined by Pearson
      product-moment correlations. Internal consistency reliability was
      estimated with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Construct validity was
      evaluated by principal component analysis using varimax rotation.
      Discriminant validity was assessed with between-groups analysis of
      variance. Main Outcome Measures.  Including the reliability and the
      validity of the CVFSFI and its domains. Results.  A total of 172 women
      (52.4%) met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for diagnosis of sexual dysfunction and
      were included in the FSD group, while 156 (47.6%) women without FSD were
      included in the control group. We showed that the overall test-retest
      reliability coefficients were high for total CVFSFI and each domain (r at
      least 0.69) and the internal consistency reliability of CVFSFI was within
      the acceptable range (Cronbach's alpha values: from 0.69 to 0.94).
      Moreover, the principal component analysis with varimax rotation produced
      six-factor structure similar to the original FSFI. We found significant
      differences in both total and domain scores between FSD and control
      groups, demonstrating a good discriminant validity of CVFSFI. Conclusion. 
      The CVFSFI is a reliable and valid questionnaire, which can be used in the
      assessment of FSD among Chinese women. Sun X, Li C, Jin L, Fan Y, and Wang

TI  - Programming Effects of Antenatal Corticosteroids Exposure in Male Sexual
      Behavior.
LID - 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02170.x [doi]
AB  - Introduction.  Brain regions implicated in sexual behavior begin to
      differentiate in the last trimester of gestation. Antenatal therapy with
      corticosteroids is often used in clinical practice during this period to
      accelerate lung maturation in preterm-risk pregnancies. Clinical and
      animal studies highlighted major behavioral impairments induced later in
      life by these treatments, especially when synthetic corticosteroids are
      used. Aim.  To evaluate the implications of acute prenatal treatment with
      natural vs. synthetic corticosteroids on adult male rat sexual behavior
      and its neurochemical correlates. Methods.  Twelve pregnant Wistar rats
      were injected with dexamethasone (DEX-1 mg/kg), corticosterone (CORT-25
      mg/kg), or saline on late gestation (pregnancy days 18 and 19). Following
      this brief exposure to corticosteroids, we assessed the sexual behavior of
      the adult male progeny and subsequently associated these behaviors with
      the levels of catecholamines and mRNA of dopamine and androgen receptors
      (AR) in brain regions relevant for sexual behavior. Main Outcome Measures.
       Sexual behavior of adult male offspring was assessed by exposure to
      receptive females. This was associated with serum testosterone levels and
      levels of catecholamines (determined by high-performance liquid
      chromatography) and dopamine and AR mRNA expression (real-time polymerase
      chain reaction [PCR]) in brain regions implicated in sexual behavior.
      Results.  Prenatal DEX exposure resulted in a decreased number and
      increased mounts and intromissions latencies in adulthood. These findings
      were associated with decreased levels of serum testosterone and increased
      hypothalamic expression of AR mRNA. DEX animals also displayed lower
      dopamine levels and higher dopamine receptor mRNA expression both in
      hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The milder phenotype of CORT
      animals was associated only with decreased dopamine levels in NAcc.
      Conclusion.  Antenatal corticotherapy programs adult male sexual behavior
      through changes in specific neuronal and endocrine mediators. Importantly,
      equipotent doses of CORT trigger less detrimental consequences than DEX,
      emphasizing the differential impact of activation of the different
      corticosteroid receptors. Oliveira M, Leao P, Rodrigues A-J, Pego J-M,

TI  - An enzymatic mechanism for generating the precursor of endogenous 13-cis
      retinoic acid in the brain.
LID - 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08019.x [doi]
AB  - 13-cis Retinoic acid (13cRA), a stereoisomeric form of retinoic acid, is
      naturally generated in the body and is also used clinically to treat acute
      promyelocytic leukemia, some skin diseases and cancer. Furthermore, it has
      been suggested that 13cRA modulates brain neurochemical systems because
      increased 13cRA levels are correlated with depression and increased
      suicidal tendencies. However, the mechanism for the generation of
      endogenous 13cRA is not well understood. The present study identified and
      characterized a novel enzyme in zebrafish brain, 13-cis isomerohydrolase
      (13cIMH) (EC 5.2.1.7), which exclusively generated 13-cis retinol and can
      be oxidized to 13cRA. 13cIMH shares 74% amino acid sequence identity with
      human retinal pigment epithelium specific 65 kDa protein (RPE65), an
      11-cis isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle, and retains the key residues
      essential for the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65. Similar to RPE65,
      13cIMH is a membrane-associated protein, requires all-trans retinyl ester
      as its intrinsic substrate, and its enzymatic activity is dependent on
      iron. The purified 13cIMH converted all-trans retinyl ester exclusively to
      13-cis retinol with K(m)  = 2.6 mum and k(cat)  = 4.4 x 10(-4) .s(-1) .
      RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry detected 13cIMH
      expression in the brain. These results suggest that 13cIMH may play a key
      role in the generation of 13cRA, as well as in the modulation of neuronal
      functions in the brain.

AB  - AIM: Pituitary incidentalomas (PIs) are diagnosed in about 10% of the
      patients undergoing radiological investigation for non-pituitary
      disorders. The aim of this study was to describe the morphological and
      hormonal characteristics of PIs in a cohort of patients, followed up in a
      single centre from 1982-2009. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of
      electronic medical records of patients with PIs was carried out. All
      patients underwent basal and dynamic evaluation of the
      hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Mass size was assessed at yearly intervals.
      RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (38 men/23 women, aged 53+/-2 years) were
      studied. The mean follow-up time was 48+/-8 months, and mean size of PIs
      was 20+/-2 mm. Twelve PIs (20%) were microadenomas, 48 (78%) were
      macroadenomas and one (2%) was a Rathke's cyst. The most common reasons
      that led to their discovery were headaches, dizziness, syncope, stroke and
      head injury. Forty-seven of the 61 PIs (77%) were non-functioning, 11
      (18%) prolactinomas, and two (3%) GH-secreting adenomas. Hypopituitarism
      was present in 12% at diagnosis. Forty-eight per cent of the patients were
      submitted to surgery with conventional radiotherapy in 8%. Relapse in size
      was observed in 48% of the surgically treated patients. Of the PIs
      followed conservatively, 78% remained stable, 11% showed decrease and 11%
      increase in size during follow up. Hypopituitarism rose to 57%
      postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of PIs are non-functioning adenomas
      that remain stable in size. Relapse in size and hypopituitarism
      postoperatively are common. PIs, for which conservative management was
      initially considered appropriate, did not progress in size.

TI  - Use of high-intensity statin therapy with simvastatin 80 mg and
      atorvastatin 80 mg in primary care.
PG  - 120-6

AB  - AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death
      worldwide. Pharmaceutical risk reduction with high-intensity statin
      therapy is advisable for high-risk patients. Clinicians face a conflict
      between prescribing for cost (simvastatin 80 mg) or for efficacy
      (atorvastatin 80 mg). The aim of this audit was to examine the use,
      efficacy and tolerability of high intensity statin treatment (simvastatin
      80 mg; atorvastatin 80 mg) in primary care. METHODOLOGY: Electronic
      medical records were examined from two general practitioners' surgeries.
      Analyses involved Mann-Whitney U and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: A total of 116
      patients had taken simvastatin 80 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg. Patients were
      similar between treatment groups: mostly men (62.9%), over 60 years old
      (68.1%), non-smokers (81.0%) taking statins for secondary prevention
      (56.9%). More patients on simvastatin withdrew from treatment as a result
      of inefficacy (49.3% vs. 23.2%, p=0.025) compared with the atorvastatin
      group. Furthermore, patients on simvastatin were more likely to be failing
      conventional targets of lipid control, compared with patients on
      atorvastatin 80 mg (43.5% vs. 21.3%, p=0.006). Tolerability was similar
      between the two groups. DISCUSSION: UK guidelines recommend simvastatin 80
      mg as an economic choice, despite scant evidence at this dose and recent
      safety concerns. Conversely, robust evidence exists for atorvastatin 80
      mg. Head-to-head clinical trials or clinical studies comparing these
      agents are lacking. The present study suggests that atorvastatin 80 mg
      compares favourably to simvastatin in terms of efficacy and has a similar
      tolerability profile. CONCLUSION: This retrospective observational study
      suggests that despite national guidelines, atorvastatin 80 mg is used in
      clinical practice and is more effective and at least as well tolerated as
      simvastatin 80 mg.

TI  - DNA glycosylase encoded by MUTYH functions as a molecular switch for
      programmed cell death under oxidative stress to suppress tumorigenesis.
LID - 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01869.x [doi]
AB  - 8-oxoguanine is a major base lesion in DNA or in nucleotides caused by
      oxidative stress, and is highly mutagenic because it can pair with adenine
      as well as cytosine. Adenine DNA glycosylase, encoded by the human mutY
      homolog gene, MUTYH, excises adenine in the nascent strand when inserted
      opposite 8-oxoguanine in template DNA, and thus suppresses mutagenesis
      caused by 8-oxoguanine that has accumulated in DNA due to oxidative
      stress. Several germ-line mutations in MUTYH are predisposed to
      MUTYH-associated polyposis, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
      by multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. Loss of function of MUTYH
      leads to an accumulation of somatic mutations in APC and KRAS genes,
      resulting in the development of adenomas/carcinomas. We recently
      demonstrated that accumulation of 8-oxoguanine in nuclear and
      mitochondrial DNA triggers two distinct cell death pathways that are
      independent of each other. Both pathways are initiated by the accumulation
      of MUTYH-generated single-strand breaks (SSBs) in nuclear or mitochondrial
      DNA. Our findings indicate that MUTYH-induced cell death due to oxidative
      stress results in an efficient elimination of mutagenic cells that have
      accumulated high levels of 8-oxoguanine in their DNAs. It is most likely
      that loss of function of MUTYH in stem or progenitor cells in the
      intestinal epithelium of MUTYH-associated polyposis patients results in
      escape from programmed cell death; however, accumulated 8-oxoguanine
      causes various mutations in APC or KRAS genes in these proliferative
      cells, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. We thus propose that MUTYH
      suppresses tumorigenesis under conditions of oxidative stress by inducing
      cell death and by suppressing mutagenesis. (Cancer Sci, doi:

AB  - To investigate the correlation between normalization of T cell receptor
      (TCR) repertoire and remission of advanced colorectal cancer. Forty-one
      patients were randomly assigned to receive either folinic
      acid/fluorouracil/irinotecan alone (n = 20) or folinic
      acid/fluorouracil/irinotecan in combination with recombinant human
      endostatin (n = 21). Efficacy and toxicity were evaluated, and changes in
      TCR repertoire diversity were assessed by detecting the spectratypes of
      TCR complementarity-determining region three before and after several
      cycles of therapy. A scoring system was used to quantify changes in the
      TCR repertoire over time. The results demonstrated that the TCR repertoire
      exhibited a higher degree of normalization among patients undergoing
      remission relative to patients experiencing tumor progression. The results
      of the current study showed a positive correlation between TCR repertoire
      normalization and remission of colorectal cancer, suggesting that dynamic
      monitoring of TCR repertoire diversity may have potential prognostic value
      in the clinical setting. (Cancer Sci, doi:

LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2010.02002.x [doi]
AB  - Macroreentrant and Focal Atrial Tachycardias. Background: Atrial
      tachycardias (ATs) are commonly observed following catheter ablation of
      atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to identify ECG
      characteristics that differentiate focal from macroreentrant ATs after
      circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI). Methods and Results: One
      hundred and twenty ATs that occurred after CPVI were mapped using a
      3-dimensional mapping system in 87 patients with AF. Further ablation was
      performed to eliminate the ATs. The surface ECGs of 68 ATs in 41
      consecutive patients (Group 1) were analyzed retrospectively to create
      diagnostic algorithms. The algorithms were tested in the second 46
      consecutive patients (Group 2). Patients with macroreentrant AT had lower
      left atrial (LA) voltage than those with focal AT (1.3 +/- 0.3 vs 1.5 +/-
      0.2 mV, P = 0.01). Focal AT had a higher incidence of a positive polarity
      in V6 compared with macroreentrant AT (88% vs 55%, P = 0.03). The positive
      amplitude of the flutter/P waves in V6 was higher for focal AT than
      macroreentrant AT. The cycle lengths of the focal ATs were longer than
      those for macroreentrant AT (296 +/- 107 vs 244 +/- 25 ms, P &lt; 0.001).
      Right atrial macroreentrant AT had a higher incidence of a negative
      polarity in at least 1 precordial lead compared with LA macroreentry. The
      positive flutter waves in V1 could differentiate roof/mitral isthmus
      dependent from non-roof/mitral isthmus dependent macroreentry. This
      algorithm correctly differentiated the focal from macroreentrant ATs with
      a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 91%, and predictive accuracy of 92%
      in Group 2. Conclusion: Different electrophysiological properties may
      facilitate the differentiation between macroreentrant and focal ATs after
      CPVI. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-8).

      Simultaneous Multielectrode Ablation Catheter.
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2010.01999.x [doi]
AB  - LA Linear Ablation With Multielectrode Catheter. Introduction: Creating
      complete linear block with point-by-point ablation is challenging in the
      left atrium (LA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy
      of LA linear ablation using a hexapolar linear multielectrode
      mapping/ablation catheter. Methods and Results: Seventeen patients (age 57
      +/- 10, 14 male, 6 paroxysmal AF (PAF)) were studied and underwent linear
      ablation at the mitral isthmus (MI) and LA roof. Ablation was performed
      with 90 second, 60  degrees C applications of duty-cycled bipolar/unipolar
      radiofrequency in a 1:1 ratio simultaneously at all selected electrode
      pairs. The result could not be evaluated in 2 patients because AF
      persisted despite cardioversion. Roof line block was confirmed in 9 of 15
      (60%) patients. The mean number of applications and the procedural time
      with and without block was 5.4 +/- 2.4 and 4.5 +/- 2.2 applications, and
      15 +/- 8 and 13 +/- 7 minutes. MI block was confirmed in 4 of 15 (27%)
      patients. The mean number of RF applications with and without block was
      5.3 +/- 2.2 and 9.9 +/- 4.4 applications, and the procedural time was 20
      +/- 9 and 27 +/- 10 minutes, respectively. For patients with underlying
      persistent AF, power was lower than those with PAF but improved when
      ablation was performed in sinus rhythm. Char was observed in 2 cases;
      however, no procedure-related complications were observed. Conclusions: In
      our initial experience, a linear multielectrode catheter using duty-cycled
      bipolar and unipolar RF energy was inferior to conventional single point
      irrigated ablation in achieving LA linear block. However, successful
      linear block was obtained within a short period of time, when it was
      achieved. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-7).

      Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2010.01995.x [doi]
AB  - Complications of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation. Introduction: Up to 6% of
      patients experience complications after radiofrequency catheter ablation
      (RFA) of atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study is to
      determine the prevalence and predictors of periprocedural complications
      after RFA for AF. Methods and Results: The subjects were 1,295 consecutive
      patients (age = 60 +/- 10 years) who underwent RFA (n = 1,642) for
      paroxysmal (53%) or persistent AF (47%) from January 2007 to January 2010.
      A complication occurred in 57 patients (3.5%); a vascular access
      complication in 31 (1.9%); pericardial tamponade in 20 (1.2%); a
      thromboembolic event in 4 (0.2%); deep venous thrombosis in 1 (&lt;0.01%);
      and pulmonary vein stenosis in 1 patient (&lt;0.01%). There were no
      procedure-related deaths. On multivariate analysis, female gender (OR =
      2.27; +/-95% CI: 1.31-2.57, P &lt; 0.01) and procedures performed in July or
      August (OR = 2.10; +/-95% CI: 1.16-3.80, P = 0.01) were independent
      predictors of any complication. For vascular complications, treatment with
      clopidogrel (OR = 4.40; +/-95% CI: 1.43-13.53, P = 0.01), female gender
      (OR = 3.65; +/-95% CI: 1.72-7.75, P &lt; 0.01) and performing RFA in July or
      August (OR = 2.71; +/-95% CI: 1.25-5.87, P = 0.01) were independent
      predictors. The only predictor of cardiac tamponade was prior RFA (OR =
      3.32; +/-95% CI: 0.95-11.61; P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Prevalence of
      perioperative complications for RFA of AF is 3.5% and vascular access
      complications constitute the majority. The need for clopidogrel therapy
      should be carefully considered prior to RFA. At teaching institutions
      close supervision should be exercised during vascular access early in the
      year. Improvements in ablation technology and elimination of the need for
      repeat procedures may decrease the risk of pericardial tamponade. (J
      Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-6).

AB  - Epicardial Adipose Tissue in Atrial Fibrillation. Introduction: As
      epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a metabolically active visceral fat,
      potential interaction between EAT and myocardium is strongly suggested.
      The aims of this study were to determine whether the amount and regional
      distribution of EAT are related to the chronicity of atrial fibrillation
      (AF) and left atrial (LA) remodeling. Methods and Results: This study
      consisted of 40 subjects with paroxysmal AF (PAF) and 40 with persistent
      AF (PeAF). Eighty subjects with no history of AF were enrolled as
      controls. Total volume of EAT (EAT(total) ), regional thickness of EAT,
      and LA volume (LAV) were measured by multislice computed tomography. In
      the AF group, blood samples were drawn from coronary sinus for analysis of
      inflammatory cytokines including adiponectin. Results: Compared with
      controls, AF subjects had larger LAV, EAT(total) , and the thicknesses of
      periatrial EAT including interatrial septum (IAS). However, the
      thicknesses of periventricular EAT were not different between the groups.
      The PeAF subjects had larger LAV, EAT(total) , and periatrial EAT
      thicknesses, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, and lower level of
      adiponectin than did the PAF subjects. Adiponection level was
      significantly associated with EAT(total) and IAS thickness. Multivariate
      analysis revealed that EAT(total) (P = 0.004) and IAS thickness (P =
      0.016) were independently associated with LAV. Conclusion: EAT(total) and
      thickness of periatrial EAT were significantly larger in AF subjects
      compared to those of the matched controls and were closely related to the
      chronicity of AF. Moreover, EAT(total) and IAS thickness were
      independently associated with LAV in subjects with AF. (J Cardiovasc
      Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-9).

      Triggers Atrial Fibrillation in Humans.

AB  - Autonomic Stimulation Induces PV Ectopy and AF. Introduction: The
      induction of atrial fibrillation (AF) by pulmonary vein (PV) ectopy is
      well described. The triggers for these PV ectopy are not so well
      understood. The intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) has been
      suggested as a potential upstream regulator that may cause PV ectopy and
      atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that activation of the ANS by
      high frequency stimulation (HFS) of atrial ganglionated plexi (GP) can
      initiate PV ectopy. Methods and Results: During sinus rhythm in 12
      patients undergoing ablation for paroxysmal AF, short bursts of HFS,
      synchronized to the local atrial refractory period, were delivered at
      presumed GP sites. Electrograms were recorded from catheters placed in the
      PV, coronary sinus (CS) and high right atrium (HRA). A total of 112
      episodes of HFS were recorded, producing ectopic activity in 91 of 112
      (81%) episodes. Of these 91 episodes, there were 46 episodes of isolated
      single ectopic beats, 5 episodes of double ectopic responses, 24 episodes
      of ectopy/tachycardia lasting &lt;30 s, and 16 episodes of AF lasting &gt;30 s.
      In 63 of 91 episodes, the PV catheter was placed adjacent to the
      stimulated GP, resulting in ectopy recorded earliest in the PV catheter in
      48 of 63 (76%) episodes. In one patient, reproducible ectopy was shown to
      occur following AV nodal conduction delay in response to HFS. Without HFS,
      neither AV nodal conduction delay nor ectopy occurred. Conclusions: This
      study has demonstrated a direct link between activation of the intrinsic
      cardiac autonomic nervous system and pulmonary vein ectopy in humans. (J
      Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-9).

      Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation in Patients With Paroxysmal Atrial

LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8167.2010.01984.x [doi]
AB  - Predictors of Recurrence after AF Ablation. Introduction: The objective of
      this study was to identify the simple preprocedural parameters of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) recurrence following single ablation procedure in
      patients with paroxysmal AF during long-term follow-up period. Methods and
      Results: Consecutive 474 patients (61 +/- 10 years; 364 males, left atrial
      (LA) diameter 37.6 +/- 5.1 mm) with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF who
      underwent AF ablation were analyzed. Pulmonary vein antrum isolation
      (PVAI), cavotricuspid isthmus line creation with bidirectional conduction
      block, and elimination of all non-PV triggers of AF were performed in all
      patients. With a mean follow-up of 30 +/- 13 months after single
      procedure, 318 patients (67.1%) were in sinus rhythm without any
      antiarrhythmic drugs. Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional
      hazards model, including the age, gender, duration of AF, body mass index,
      LA size, left ventricular ejection fraction, and presence of hypertension
      and structural heart disease as variables, demonstrated that LA size was
      an independent predictor of AF recurrences after PVAI with a 7.2% increase
      in the probability for every 1 mm increase in LA diameter (P = 0.0007).
      When the patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the LA
      diameter, the patients with moderate (40-50 mm) and severe dilatation (&gt;50
      mm) had a 1.30-fold (P = 0.0131) and 2.14-fold (P = 0.0057) increase,
      respectively, in the probability of recurrent AF as compared with the
      patients with normal LA diameter (&lt;/=40 mm). Conclusion : In the long-term
      follow-up period, LA size was the best preprocedural predictor of AF
      recurrence following single ablation procedure in the patients with
      paroxysmal AF, even in the patients with a relatively small LA. (J
      Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-5).

AB  - Twelve-Lead ECG Interpretation in a Patient With Presumed Left Atrial
      Flutter. The 12-lead ECG provides valuable clues to the mechanism and
      origin of organized tachycardias occurring in patients after catheter
      ablation of atrial fibrillation. Many of these patients have cavotricuspid
      isthmus-dependent flutter, and therefore it is important to be aware of
      variations from the norm of typical flutter. Left atrial reentrant
      tachycardias are, however, the most common arrhythmias encountered after
      catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. The underlying circuits are
      typically formed around anatomic obstacles such as the PV ostia or the
      mitral valve, and facilitated by slow conducting, low voltage isthmuses
      through gaps through and bordering ablation lesions. They can be
      recognized by the presence of 12-lead synchronous iso-electric intervals
      separating flutter waves. Continuous activity ECGs (without 12-lead
      iso-electric intervals) are typical of larger size reentrant circuits not
      dependent on markedly slow conducting isthmuses. Delayed bystander
      activity can also however obscure iso-electric intervals. The integration
      of informed ECG analysis with a detailed knowledge of the index ablation
      strategy can provide an optimum platform for successful catheter ablation
      of these often very symptomatic arrhythmias. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol,
      Vol. pp. 1-5).

AB  - Congestive Heart Failure After Catheter Ablation for AF. Introduction:
      This study sought to describe a new complication of catheter ablation for
      atrial fibrillation (AF): new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) after
      extensive ablation for AF. Methods and Results: Data from 12 patients
      developing CHF after ablation were prospectively collected. All patients
      underwent extensive ablation for AF including circumferential pulmonary
      venous ablation and complex fractionated atrial electrograms guided
      ablation. CHF was diagnosed using the following criteria: symptoms or
      signs of heart failure, elevated BNP, and echocardiographic evidence of
      left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Twelve patients (5 persistent and
      7 permanent AF) had CHF after extensive ablation out of 484 consecutive AF
      patients who underwent catheter ablation (prevalence 2.5%). None of these
      12 patients had CHF prior to the procedure. The mean onset of the symptoms
      was 39 +/- 14 hours after the index procedure. Dyspnea and pulmonary rales
      were the most observed symptoms or signs. White blood cell count, serum
      CRP, BNP, and echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction (E/A, E/E') were significantly increased after the onset of
      symptoms. All patients had complete recovery with supportive therapy
      within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. Conclusions: In this single-center
      experience, CHF after extensive ablation for AF was a well-recognized
      complication with a relatively high incidence of 2.5%. Measurement of BNP,
      CRP, and E/A, E/E' is useful in managing these patients. (J Cardiovasc
      Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-6).

AB  - The Role of Endomyocardial Biopsy in ARVC.  Arrhythmogenic right
      ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterized by a high incidence of
      ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death that appear early in
      the natural history of the disease and may precede significant ventricular
      remodeling. The classical pathology of ARVC is degeneration of right
      ventricular free wall myocardium and its replacement by fat and fibrous
      tissue. The clinical presentation may be highly variable, however, and
      genetic penetrance is typically low which makes definitive diagnosis
      difficult, especially in early stages of the disease. Endomyocardial
      biopsy (EMB) has not been used widely in the diagnosis of ARVC, in part
      because pathological changes are usually most conspicuous in the
      epicardium of the right ventricular free wall and tend to spare the
      endocardium and interventricular septum. Thus, diagnostic pathological
      features of ARVC are often not seen in conventional septal biopsies.
      Diagnostic yield may be increased by sampling the RV free wall or by using
      3-dimensional electroanatomic voltage mapping to identify affected areas,
      but these approaches can carry increased risk and require specialized
      equipment and experience. Moreover, diagnostic pathological changes may
      not be apparent in early disease despite an increased risk of arrhythmias
      and sudden death. This review considers the role of EMB in the diagnosis
      of ARVC and highlights recent advances in identifying potential tissue
      biomarkers that arise early in the disease process and occur diffusely
      throughout the myocardium. Analysis of conventional EMB using such
      biomarkers could improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy but
      widespread clinical application of this approach requires further
      validation.

PG  - 1089-100

AB  - Control of DNA replication initiation is essential for bacterial cells to
      co-ordinate the faithful replication and segregation of their genetic
      material. The Bacillus subtilis ATPase Soj is a dynamic protein that
      regulates DNA replication initiation by either inhibiting or activating
      the DNA replication initiator protein DnaA. Here we report that the key
      event which switches Soj regulatory activity is a transition in its
      oligomeric state from a monomer to an ATP-dependent homodimer capable of
      DNA binding. We show that the DNA binding activity of the Soj dimer is
      required both for activation of DNA replication initiation and for
      interaction with Spo0J. Finally, we demonstrate that Spo0J inhibits Soj
      dimerization by stimulating Soj ATPase activity. The data provide a
      molecular explanation for the dichotomous regulatory activities of Soj, as
      well as assigning unique Soj conformations to distinct cellular
      localization patterns. We discuss how the regulation of Soj ATPase
      activity by Spo0J could be utilized to control the initiation of DNA
      replication during the cell cycle.

AB  - Gerodontology 2011; doi: 10.1111/j.1741-2358.2011.00460.x Evaluation of
      partially dentate patients' knowledge about caries and periodontal disease
      Objective:  This investigation evaluated the knowledge of dental caries
      and periodontal disease among removable partial denture (RPD) wearers.
      Method:  A total of 127 partially dentate patients participated in this
      observational study. A structured questionnaire, which included eight
      questions referring to knowledge about aetiology and prevention of dental
      caries and periodontal disease, was developed in the local language
      (Portuguese) and used to collect the data of all the partial denture
      wearers. A descriptive analysis of data was performed by means of drafting
      tables. Results:  The results demonstrated that 68.5% of patients
      interviewed had previously received information about oral health care.
      With regard to bacterial plaque, it was observed that only 34.6% reported
      having knowledge of this. Whereas, in relation to caries, 76.4% of the
      interviewees replied that they knew the meaning of this. Nevertheless,
      28.3% referred to caries as a whole in the teeth, 16.5% as bad teeth and
      9.4% bacteria/creatures on the teeth. Only 17.3% of the partially
      edentulous patients evaluated were shown to know what disease of the
      gingiva was. Conclusion:  By means of the methodology applied, it could be
      concluded that the patients who wore RPDs presented deficient knowledge
      with regard to the prevention, aetiology and development of dental caries
      and periodontal disease.

      health status in the elderly with different levels of education: a 5-year
      follow-up study Objective:  To assess the association between the
      periodontal health status and level of education over a 5-year period
      among the elderly aged 75 years and older. Background:  Oral health among
      the higher educated is known to be better than among the less-well
      educated. On the other hand, the prevalence and severity of periodontal
      disease has been found to grow with increasing age. Methods:  The
      participants were derived from a population-based Helsinki Aging Study, a
      random sample of 76-, 81- and 86-year-old elderly. The 170 dentate elderly
      who underwent clinical oral examinations at baseline and 71 who
      participated in the follow-up were included in this study. The data was
      collected from intraoral and radiological examinations and from a
      structured questionnaire. Results:  Subjects with a higher level of
      education had more retained teeth than subjects with a lower level of
      education. According to CPITN index, better-educated participants had more
      healthy sextants, but they also had more sextants with periodontal
      pockets. Radiographic examination showed similar results. Conclusion: 
      Level of education has a clear effect on the periodontal health status in
      the elderly. More treatment need seems to polarise into those elderly who
      are better educated as they retain more teeth into old age.

      10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01696.x ABSTRACT: Aim: This in vitro study was
      established to investigate whether the regenerative capacity of
      periodontal ligament (PDL) cells in the presence of enamel matrix
      derivative (EMD) is modulated by inflammation. Materials and Methods: PDL
      cells were grown in the presence or absence of EMD under normal and
      inflammatory conditions for up to 14 days. In order to mimic an
      inflammatory environment, cells were incubated with interleukin
      (IL)-1beta. Cells were also exposed to transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-beta1 and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 under both conditions.
      For analysis of wound healing, an in vitro wound fill assay was used. The
      synthesis of growth factors, markers of proliferation, and osteogenic
      differentiation, as well as collagen was studied by real-time polymerase
      chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and immunoblotting.
      Mineralization was assessed by alizarine red S and von Kossa staining.
      Results: EMD stimulated significantly the in vitro wound fill rate, cell
      proliferation and adhesion, synthesis of growth factors, and collagen, as
      well as mineralization. In the presence of IL-1beta, these EMD effects
      were significantly reduced. IL-1beta also inhibited significantly the
      wound fill rate induced by TGF-beta1 and IGF-1. Conclusions: Critical PDL
      cell functions that are associated with periodontal regeneration are
      reduced in an inflammatory environment.

      2011; doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01683.x ABSTRACT: Aim: The temporal
      pattern of bone-level alterations in conventionally restored implants is
      dependent upon healing mode (open or submerged). This study examined the
      influence of healing on marginal bone levels at implants with a
      medium-rough surface including the implant collar and a clearance-fit
      implant-abutment connection restored according to a platform-switching
      concept. Material and Methods: Two implants were placed in the posterior
      mandible of 21 test subjects, randomly assigned to open (OH) or submerged
      (SH) healing. Standardized radiographs were obtained after implant
      surgery, before re-entry, after crown mounting, 1 and 2 years after
      implant surgery, and evaluated for implant-bone-level alterations
      (DeltaIBL). Bacterial samples of the implants' inner cavities were
      analysed by cultivation. Statistics: Brunner-Langer Model, equivalence
      testings by Wilcoxon's (equivalence range +/-0.4 mm). Results: After 2
      years, DeltaIBL were -0.47+/-0.46 mm (OH) and -0.54+/-0.38 mm (SH). At the
      1-year follow-up, all implants were contaminated with bacteria. DeltaIBL
      (p&lt;0.001) and the amount of bacterial contamination (p&lt;0.001)
      significantly depended on time, but not on healing mode. DeltaIBL of OH
      and SH were equivalent at all time points (all p0.044). Conclusions:
      Platform-switched implants showed very limited peri-implant bone-level
      alterations. The healing-mode neither affected the total amount nor the
      temporal patterns of DeltaIBL. Thus, the results for the tested implants
      with a non-rigid implant-abutment connection were similar to results
      reported previously for implants with a rigid implant-abutment connection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Glycyrrhizin is the main water-soluble constituent of the root
      of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra). The study investigates the effect of
      glycyrrhizin on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic changes and
      associated oxidative stress, including haemoglobin-induced free
      iron-mediated oxidative reactions. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were grouped
      as normal control, STZ-induced diabetic control, normal treated with
      glycyrrhizin, diabetic treated with glycyrrhizin and diabetic treated with
      a standard anti-hyperglycaemic drug, glibenclamide. Different parameters
      were studied in blood and tissue samples of the rats. KEY FINDINGS:
      Glycyrrhizin treatment improved significantly the diabetogenic effects of
      STZ, namely enhanced blood glucose level, glucose intolerant behaviour,
      decreased serum insulin level including pancreatic islet cell numbers,
      increased glycohaemoglobin level and enhanced levels of cholesterol and
      triglyceride. The treatment significantly reduced diabetes-induced
      abnormalities of pancreas and kidney tissues. Oxidative stress parameters,
      namely, serum superoxide dismutase, catalase, malondialdehyde and
      fructosamine in diabetic rats were reverted to respective normal values
      after glycyrrhizin administration. Free iron in haemoglobin, iron-mediated
      free radical reactions and carbonyl formation in haemoglobin were
      pronounced in diabetes, and were counteracted by glycyrrhizin. Effects of
      glycyrrhizin and glibenclamide treatments appeared comparable. CONCLUSION:
      Glycyrrhizin is quite effective against hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia
      and associated oxidative stress, and may be a potential therapeutic agent
      for diabetes treatment.

TI  - Decreased activity of the 20S proteasome in the brain white matter and
      gray matter of patients with multiple sclerosis.
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07182.x [doi]
AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07182.x ABSTRACT:
      Carbonylated (oxidized) proteins are known to accumulate in the cerebral
      white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) of patients with multiple sclerosis
      (MS). Although oxidative stress is necessary for carbonyl generation, it
      is the failure of the degradation systems that ultimately leads to the
      build-up of carbonylated proteins within tissues. In this study, we
      measured the activity of the 20S proteasome and other proteolytic systems
      in the cerebral WM and GM of 13 MS patients and 13 controls. We report
      that the activities of the three peptidases of the 20S proteasome (i.e.
      chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like and trypsin-like) in both MS-WM and MS-GM
      are greatly reduced. Interestingly, neither the amount of proteasome nor
      the levels of the catalytic subunits (beta1, beta2, and beta5) are
      diminished in this disease. Proteins containing Lys-48 poly-ubiquitin also
      accumulate in MS tissues, indicating failure of the 26S proteasome as
      well. Levels of the regulatory caps 11S alpha and 19S are also lower in MS
      than in controls, suggesting that the activity of the more complex
      proteasomes may be reduced further. Finally, the activities of other
      proteases that might also remove oxidized proteins (calpain, cathepsin B,
      mitochondrial LonP) are not lessened in MS. Together, these studies
      suggest that direct inactivation of proteolytic centers in the 20S
      particle and/or the presence of specific inhibitors is the underlying
      cause of proteasomal dysfunction in MS.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07180.x ABSTRACT: Increasing
      evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-binding histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6)
      plays an important role in the clearance of misfolded proteins by
      autophagy. In this study, we treated PC-12 cells over-expressing human
      mutant (A53T) alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and SH-SY5Y cells with MPP(+) .
      It was found that HDAC6 expression significantly increased and mainly
      colocalized with alpha-syn in the perinuclear region to form
      aggresome-like bodies. HDAC6 deficiency blocked the formation of
      aggresome-like bodies and interfered with the autophagy in response to
      MPP(+) -induced stress. Moreover, misfolded alpha-syn accumulated into the
      nuclei, resulting in its reduced clearance, and finally, the number of
      apoptotic cells significantly increased. Taken together, HDAC6
      participated in the degradation of MPP(+) -induced misfolded alpha-syn
      aggregates by regulating the aggresome-autophagy pathway. Understanding
      the mechanism may disclose potential therapeutic targets for
      synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07179.x ABSTRACT: Cerebral
      dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is a novel evolutionary conserved
      protein which can protect and restore the function of dopaminergic neurons
      in the rat model of Parkinson's disease, suggesting that CDNF might be
      beneficial for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. CDNF is widely
      expressed in neurons in several brain regions including cerebral cortex,
      hippocampus, substantia nigra, striatum and cerebellum. Human CDNF is
      glycosylated and secreted from transiently transfected cells; however, the
      mechanism underlying CDNF secretion is currently unclear. In this study,
      we found that CDNF could be secreted primarily via the regulated secretion
      pathway in PC12 cells. The glycosylation of CDNF is not required for its
      secretion. Moreover, we identified two key subdomains in CDNF which are
      important for its intracellular localization and secretion. Disrupting
      helix-1 of CDNF significantly reduces its constitutive and regulated
      secretion and the helix-1 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum.
      Although helix-7 mutation only decreases CDNF regulated secretion and has
      no effect on its constitutive secretion, which is further supported by the
      reduction in co-localization of helix-7 mutant with secretory granules. In
      all, these findings will advance our understanding of the molecular
      mechanism of CDNF trafficking and secretion.

TI  - Adenosine A(2A) receptors control neuroinflammation and consequent
      hippocampal neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07178.x ABSTRACT: The
      blockade of adenosine A(2A) receptors (A2AR) affords a robust
      neuroprotection in different noxious brain conditions. However, the
      mechanisms underlying this general neuroprotection are unknown. One
      possible mechanism could be the control of neuroinflammation that is
      associated with brain damage, especially because A2AR efficiently control
      peripheral inflammation. Thus, we tested if the intracerebroventricular
      injection of a selective A2AR antagonist (SCH58261) would attenuate the
      changes in the hippocampus triggered by intraperitoneal administration of
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that induces neuroinflammation through microglia
      activation. LPS administration triggers an increase in inflammatory
      mediators like interleukin-1beta that causes biochemical changes (p38 and
      c-jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation and caspase 3 activation)
      contributing to neuronal dysfunction typified by decreased long-term
      potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity. Long-term potentiation,
      measured 30 min after the tetanus, was significantly lower in LPS-treated
      rats compared with control-treated rats, while SCH58261 attenuated the
      LPS-induced change. The LPS-induced increases in phosphorylation of c-jun
      N-terminal kinase and p38 and activation of caspase 3 were also prevented
      by SCH58261. Significantly, SCH58261 also prevented the LPS-induced
      recruitment of activated microglial cells and the increase in
      interleukin-1beta concentration in the hippocampus, indicating that A2AR
      activation is a pivotal step in mediating the neuroinflammation triggered
      by LPS. These results indicate that A2AR antagonists prevent
      neuroinflammation and support the hypothesis that this mechanism might
      contribute for the ability of A2AR antagonists to control different
      neurodegenerative diseases known to involve neuroinflammation.

AB  - Sixty novel simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed from
      expressed sequence tags (EST) of half-smooth tongue sole Cynoglossus
      semilaevis exploited in the laboratory. The number of alleles, observed
      and expected heterozygosity per locus ranged from two to 16, from 0.0833
      to 1.0000 and from 0.0816 to 0.913, respectively. Of these SSRs, 20 had
      significant homology to known genes by BLASTx (basic local alignment
      search tool x) search. For cross-species amplification, there are 53
      positive amplifications in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus with
      12 polymorphic loci and 51 positive amplifications in Senegalese sole
      Solea senegalensis with 11 polymorphic loci. These new EST-SSR markers
      will be useful for genetic studies and genome mapping of C. semilaevis and
      its closely related fishes.

AB  - This study provides the first detailed information on the reproductive
      biology of the lesser guitarfish Zapteryx brevirostris in the
      south-western Atlantic Ocean between latitudes 34 degrees  and 42 degrees 
      S. A total of 320 males (196-647 mm total length, L(T)) and 336 females
      (200-640 mm L(T)) were analysed. No significant differences were observed
      in size at 50% maturity between males (499 mm L(T)) and females (506 mm
      L(T)). Three seasonal patterns were related to the testes mass, the
      development of spermatocysts and the presence of spermatozoa in genital
      ducts. Females showed a 3 year reproductive cycle, with 2 years of ovarian
      maturation and 1 year of gestation, including a mean annual fecundity of
      one to two embryos. Synchronicity of both ovulating females and males with
      sperm in genital ducts indicated that ovulation and hence mating occurs
      during winter. Birth was assumed to occur during winter, but neither
      ovulation nor mating is simultaneous with this reproductive event. Despite
      its low economic value, a decline in abundance in the region, together
      with a low reproductive efficiency, indicates that the Z. brevirostris
      population should be monitored closely.

LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04317.x [doi]
AB  - In coeliac disease, the intake of dietary gluten induces small-bowel
      mucosal damage and the production of immunoglobulin (Ig)A class
      autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TG2). We examined the effect of
      coeliac patient IgA on the apical-to-basal passage of gluten-derived
      gliadin peptides p31-43 and p57-68 in intestinal epithelial cells. We
      demonstrate that coeliac IgA enhances the passage of gliadin peptides,
      which could be abolished by inhibition of TG2 enzymatic activity.
      Moreover, we also found that both the apical and the basal cell culture
      media containing the immunogenic gliadin peptides were able to induce the
      proliferation of deamidation-dependent coeliac patient-derived T cells
      even in the absence of exogenous TG2. Our results suggest that coeliac
      patient IgA could play a role in the transepithelial passage of gliadin
      peptides, a process during which they might be deamidated.

TI  - Induction of beta-defensins by l-isoleucine as novel immunotherapy in
      experimental murine tuberculosis.
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04313.x [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis is a worldwide health problem, and multidrug-resistant (MDR)
      and extensively multidrug-resistant (XMDR) strains are rapidly emerging
      and threatening the control of this disease. These problems motivate the
      search for new treatment strategies. One potential strategy is
      immunotherapy using cationic anti-microbial peptides. The capacity of
      l-isoleucine to induce beta-defensin expression and its potential
      therapeutic efficiency were studied in a mouse model of progressive
      pulmonary tuberculosis. BALB/c mice were infected with Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis strain H37Rv or with a MDR clinical isolate by the
      intratracheal route. After 60 days of infection, when disease was in its
      progressive phase, mice were treated with 250 microg of intratracheal
      l-isoleucine every 48 h. Bacillary loads were determined by colony-forming
      units, protein and cytokine gene expression were determined by
      immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-qPCR), respectively, and tissue damage was quantified
      by automated morphometry. Administration of l-isoleucine induced a
      significant increase of beta-defensins 3 and 4 which was associated with
      decreased bacillary loads and tissue damage. This was seen in animals
      infected with the antibiotic-sensitive strain H37Rv and with the MDR
      clinical isolate. Thus, induction of beta-defensins might be a potential
      therapy that can aid in the control of this significant infectious
      disease.

AB  - Nucleic acid sensors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family play a
      well-established role in the pathogenesis of lupus. This is particularly
      true for a single-stranded RNA-sensing TLR-7 receptor, as lupus mice
      lacking TLR-7 show ameliorated disease. Cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide
      (CpG)-DNA-sensing TLR-9, conversely, has a complex regulatory role in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Much less is known about whether
      signals through the B cell receptor for antigen (BCR) may affect the
      ability of B cells to respond to suboptimal TLR-7 agonists and
      antagonists. We studied this question in prediseased BXSB male and female
      B cells. We found that male B cells responded more vigorously to numerous
      TLR-7 ligands and this responsiveness was enhanced further upon
      co-engagement of the BCR. This synergy was seen primarily with the
      interleukin (IL)-6 secretion. A number of 32-mer inhibitory
      oligonucleotides (INH-ODNs) with a nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate
      backbone were capable of blocking TLR-7, but not BCR-induced B cell
      activation, with an inhibitory concentration (IC)(50) of approximately 100
      nm. Surprisingly, while the presence of a single TGC motif at the 5' end
      of an ODN did not increase its inhibitory capacity, INH-ODNs containing
      multiple TGC motifs had greater inhibitory potency. When BCR and TLR-7
      were co-engaged, INH-ODNs showed a differential effect on B cell
      activation. Whereas apoptosis protection and G1-M entry completely escaped
      suppression, IL-6 secretion remained sensitive to inhibition, although
      with a 10-fold lower potency. Our results suggest that while TLR-7
      antagonists may be considered as lupus therapeutics, simultaneous
      co-engagement of the TLR-7 and BCR might favour autoreactive B cell
      survival. This hypothesis needs further experimental validation.

AB  - To clarify the association of genetic producibility of interleukin (IL)-5,
      IL-6 and IL-13, which are secreted by T helper type 2 (Th2), with the
      development and prognosis of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), we
      genotyped IL5-746C/T, IL6-572C/G and IL13-1112C/T polymorphisms, which are
      functional polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the genes regulating
      these cytokines. Fifty-seven patients with intractable Graves' disease
      (GD), 52 with GD in remission, 52 with severe Hashimoto's disease (HD), 56
      with mild HD and 91 healthy controls were examined in this study. The
      IL13-1112T allele, which correlates with higher producibility of IL-13,
      was more frequent in patients with GD in remission than in those with
      intractable GD [P = 0.009, odds ratio (OR) = 3.52]. The IL5-746T allele,
      which may correlate with lower levels of IL-5, was more frequent in
      patients with GD in remission than controls (P = 0.029, OR = 2.00). The
      IL6-572G allele carriers (CG and GG genotypes), which have higher
      producibility of IL-6, were more frequent in AITD patients (P = 0.033, OR
      = 1.75), especially in GD in remission (P = 0.031, OR = 2.16) and severe
      HD (P = 0.031, OR = 2.16) than in controls. Interestingly, both allele and
      genotype frequencies of Th2 cytokine genes were similar between GD and HD
      patients. In conclusion, functional polymorphisms in the genes encoding
      Th2 cytokines are associated differently with the development and
      prognosis of AITD from each other.

TI  - Reversal of cardiac iron loading and dysfunction in thalassemic mice by
      curcuminoids.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - Non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) is found in plasma of beta-thalassemia
      patients and causes oxidative tissue damage. Cardiac siderosis and
      complications are the secondary cause of death in beta-thalassemia major
      patients. Desferrioxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP) and deferasirox (DFX)
      are promising chelators used to get negative iron balance and improve life
      quality. DFP has been shown to remove myocardial iron effectively.
      Curcuminoids (CUR) can chelate plasma NTBI, inhibit lipid peroxidation and
      alleviate cardiac autonomic imbalance. Effects of CUR on cardiac iron
      deposition and function were investigated in iron-loaded mice. Wild type
      ((mu)beta(+/+) WT) and heterozygous beta-knockout ((mu)beta(th-3/+) BKO)
      mice (C57BL/6) were fed with ferrocene-supplemented diet (Fe diet) and
      coincidently intervened with CUR and DFP for 2 months. Concentrations of
      plasma NTBI and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using HPLC techniques.
      Heart iron concentration was determined based on atomic absorption
      spectrophotometry and Perl's staining methods. Short-term
      electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded with AD Instruments Power Lab, and
      heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated using MATLAB 7.0 program. Fe
      diet increased levels of NTBI and MDA in plasma, nonheme iron and iron
      deposit in heart tissue significantly, and depressed the HRV, which the
      levels were higher in the BKO mice than the WT mice. CUR and DFP
      treatments lowered plasma NTBI as well as MDA concentrations (p &lt;0.05),
      heart iron accumulation effectively, and also improved the HRV in the
      treated mice. The results imply that CUR would be effective in decreasing
      plasma NTBI and myocardial iron, alleviating lipid peroxidation and
      improving cardiac function in iron-loaded thalassemic mice.

TI  - Erbin, a negative regulator in diverse signal pathways.
PG  - 759-64
AB  - Erbin belongs to the LAP protein family. It represents a novel type of
      adaptor protein that features targeting of basolateral localization of the
      Her2 receptor through direct binding to the Her2 C terminus. Recent
      studies demonstrated that Erbin could inhibit the Ras-mediated activation
      of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappaB
      (NF-kappaB) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling
      pathways. It suggests that Erbin may function as a signaling molecule. The
      functions of Erbin in determining cell polarity and cell adhesion have
      been well described. This review mainly focuses on the recent findings in
      regulation of signaling pathways by Erbin.

TI  - Role of Insulin Signaling in the Interaction Between Alzheimer Disease and
      Diabetes Mellitus: A Missing Link to Therapeutic Potential.
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the major non-genetic risk factors for
      Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which DM increases the
      risk of AD has not been elucidated. Here, we summarize recent findings to
      address this question. Whereas neuropathological studies in humans suggest
      that DM does not increase Abeta accumulation in the brain (a major
      hallmark of AD), earlier works in animal models show that Abeta does
      accumulate. Therefore, alternate mechanisms might exist. Recent studies
      using the human brain indicate that insulin signaling is impaired in the
      AD brain. In neurons, this insulin signaling plays a key role in
      modulating synaptic function and neuronal senescence besides regulating
      tau phosphorylation, another hallmark of AD. On the other hand, in
      cerebrovessels, DM causes vascular remodeling, which involves increased
      RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) expression, and AD is
      associated with cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Our recent study
      involving AD mice with DM has revealed that a vicious circle underlies the
      interaction between AD and DM. Interestingly, in our mouse model, AD
      increased RAGE expression, and DM worsened CAA. The contribution of
      vascular factors such as RAGE expression and CAA to the impairment of
      insulin signaling will be discussed. This impaired insulin signaling might
      be a possible link between AD and DM. Moreover, insulin signaling is also
      involved in the mechanism of aging, decreasing with an increase in age. An
      identification of the mechanism whereby DM modifies the pathological
      condition of AD through the modulation of insulin signaling is required to
      develop potential therapeutics for AD not only with but also without DM.

TI  - Effects of a Long-Term Treatment with an Antioxidant Pyridoindole on
      Vascular Responsiveness in Diabetes-Induced Aging Rats.
AB  - Impaired vascular reactivity is a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases
      induced by diabetes, which is also an accelerated aging model. This study
      was designed to investigate the effect of chronic treatment of stobadine,
      a pyridoindole antioxidant, on vascular responsiveness in diabetic
      animals. Age- (13-week old) and gender-matched Wistar rats were randomly
      divided as control and diabetic. Streptozotocin (55mg/kg, i.p.) was used
      to induce experimental diabetes. After induction of diabetes, rats
      randomly assigned for receving stobadine (24.7 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or its
      vehicle for 8-10 months. Stobadine treatment significantly reduced the
      severity of hyperglycemia, heart and kidney weights, systolic blood
      pressure, and prevented diabetes-induced loss in body weight gain.
      Concentration-dependent vasoconstriction responses to phenylephrine (PE)
      and BayK-8644 were significantly attenuated by stobadine treatment in
      diabetes. Although stobadine treatment increased acetylcholine
      (ACh)-induced relaxation responses, sodium nitroprusside-induced
      relaxations were not affected by the treatment. Stobadine treatment
      markedly inhibited A23187-induced relaxation responses while remains
      unchanged in diabetics compared to controls. The sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
      reticulum calcium ATPase inhibibition by cyclopiazonic acid (10-6 M) or
      thapsigargin (TH; 10-6 M) inhibited the transient vasoconstriction to PE
      in control and diabetic groups. TH also inhibited the relaxant effect of a
      single dose of ACh (3x10-6 M) in control and stobadine-treated diabetic
      groups. These results suggest that antioxidant-protective effect on NO and
      the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ current by receptor-operated
      and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel pathways rather than particular effect
      on endothelial Ca2+ mobilization contribute to the mechanisms responsible
      for the vascular responsiveness regulatory effect of stobadine, giving
      rise to maintenance of blood pressure at physiological levels in vivo in
      aged diabetic rats.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of Stavudine Loaded Injectable Polymeric
      Particulate Systems.
AB  - Present research investigates the formulation of stavudine loaded
      biodegradable microspheres from different grades of Poly (D, L
      Lactide-co-glycolide) as a depot system for parenteral delivery. Prolonged
      release of stavudine facilitates reduction in symptoms of HIV infection
      and delay AIDS progression by reducing viral load to undetectable levels.
      Microspheres were prepared from PLGA 85:15 and PLGA 50:50 (RESOMER((R))
      505H) by solvent evaporation technique with different drug/polymer ratios
      (1:4, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100) and a polymer solution/vehicle ratio of
      1:2. The effects of various formulation variables like polymer type and
      concentration, surfactant concentration and drug to polymer ratio on the
      characteristics of microspheres were evaluated. All thirteen formulations
      of microspheres were evaluated for yield, entrapment efficiency, particle
      size and In vitro release studies. Microspheres were characterized by
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry
      (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), residual solvent analysis and confocal
      laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Microspheres showed excellent surface
      topography with uniform distribution and structural integrity of the drug.
      Resulting microspheres showed the maximum entrapment efficiency of 68.0
      +/- 1.62% and mean particle diameter below 100micro. Drug release kinetics
      data were obtained from various kinetic models and best explained by
      &quot;Higuchi Kinetic&quot; i.e. drug release was largely governed by diffusion
      through water-filled pores in the matrix. Korsmeyer-Peppas equation
      depicted that drug release mechanism is anomalous transport, i.e.
      diffusion as well as polymer relaxation. Drug release from microspheres
      exhibited the characteristic release pattern of a monolithic matrix system
      with a maximum of 80-90% drug release in 6-8 weeks demonstrating the
      feasibility of prolonged delivery of stavudine using biodegradable
      microspheres for parenteral depot system.

TI  - Tigecycline Treatment of Critically Ill Patients: The Latin User
      Experience.
AB  - Tigecycline is the first of a new class of antibiotics named
      glycylcyclines and it was approved for the treatment of complicated
      intra-abdominal infections and skin and skin structure infections and
      community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Notwithstanding this, the
      tigecycline's pharmacological and microbiological profile encourage
      physicians' use of the drug in other infections. The aim of this study was
      to characterize the indications type, pathogens, and outcomes of patients
      who were treated with tigecycline. We analyzed the tigecycline
      prescriptions in 209 patients in 23 Latin American centres using an
      electronic form included in the website LatinUser()
      (http://www.clinicalrec.com.ar). Sixty-six patients (31.5%) received
      tigecycline for approved indications, and 143 (68.5%) for &quot;off label&quot;
      indications (47% with scientific support and 21.5% with limited or without
      any scientific support). The most frequent &quot;off label&quot; use was
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (76 patients). The etiology of
      infections was established in 88 patients (42%). Acinetobacter spp.
      (54.5%, in 65% of cases carbapenems-resistant), methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (12%), and extended spectrum
      beta-lactamases-producing Enterobacteriaceae (10%) were the most common
      microorganisms isolated. Overall, attending physicians reported clinical
      success in 144 of the 209 patients (69%). Global mortality proportion was
      35,5% (74/209 patients). Our study shows that the off label use of
      tigecycline is frequent, especially in VAP due to multidrug-resistant
      pathogens, where the therapeutic options are limited (eg:
      carbapenems-resistant Acinetobacter spp.). Physicians must evaluate the
      benefits/risks to use this antibiotic for indications that lack rigorous
      scientific support.

TI  - Treatment of Fabry Disease: Current and Emerging Strategies.
AB  - Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) due to
      deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (GLA). Absent or reduced
      enzyme activity leads to impaired catabolism of neutral
      glycosphingolipids, particularly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), resulting in
      intracellular deposition of such lipids. Clinical manifestations in
      hemizygote males include angiokeratoma, hypohydrosis, acroparesthesia,
      abdominal pain, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, left ventricular
      hypertrophy and cerebrovascular accidents. Heterozygote women may present
      with mild to severe signs and symptoms. Since year 2001, enzyme
      replacement therapy (ERT) is the only specific treatment for Fabry
      disease. The beneficial effect of ERT on different organs/systems has been
      extensively evaluated, and an improvement in renal function, cardiac mass
      and quality of life has been reported. Different treatment approaches are
      currently on development. One of them implies the use of the
      active-site-specific chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin that acts
      facilitating folding of mutant GLA in the endoplasmic reticulum and
      increasing its lysosomal residual activity. Reduction of Gb3 deposits has
      been shown in lymphoblasts from Fabry patients with missense mutations and
      transgenic mouse model expressing a missense mutation GLA. Gene therapy
      has been also developed as a potential option for treatment of Fabry
      disease. This review will discuss these novel therapeutic options along
      with their advantages and limitations.

TI  - Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (Hunter Syndrome): Clinical Picture and
      Treatment.
AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type II (Hunter syndrome, OMIM 309900) is an
      X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the
      lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS). Major clinical
      manifestations include joint contractures, obstructive and restrictive
      airway disease, cardiac disease, skeletal deformities and often mental
      retardation. As with all the MPS disorders, mucopolysaccharidosis type II
      is a clinically heterogeneous disease in terms of the extent and rate of
      progression of organ impairment in affected individuals. Common causes of
      death, which usually occurs within the second decade of life, are
      obstructive airway disease and cardiac failure due to valvular
      dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and myocardial disease. Patients with
      the more attenuated (so-called adult) form usually have a normal
      intelligence, but often have many complaints such as progressive loss of
      vision due to retinal dysfunction, spastic paresis due to myelon
      compression at the cranio-cerevical region, severe hip disease and cardiac
      complications. Clinical investigations that have been performed in the
      last years in a great number of patients have shown that many of these
      complications are still underdiagnosed and untreated. Until recently, no
      specific treatment was available for the affected patients; management
      mainly consisted of supportive care and treatment of complications. Enzyme
      replacement therapy with recombinant iduronate-2-sulphatase (idursulfase),
      however, has now been introduced. And it could be demonstrated that weekly
      intravenous infusions of idursulfase is able to improve many of the
      symptoms and signs of Hunter syndrome. This review will present the
      efficacy and safety data of the enzyme preparation and discuss benefits
      and limitations of this new therapeutic option.

TI  - Therapeutic Approaches to the Challenge of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses.
AB  - The Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are lysosomal storage diseases
      (LSDs) affecting the central nervous system (CNS), with generally
      recessive inheritance. They are characterized by pathological
      lipofuscin-like material accumulating in cells. The clinical phenotypes at
      all onset ages show progressive loss of vision, decreasing cognitive and
      motor skills, epileptic seizures and premature death, with dementia
      without visual loss prominent in the rarer adult forms. Eight causal
      genes, CLN10/CTSD, CLN1/PPT1, CLN2/TPP1, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, CLN7/MFSD8,
      CLN8, with more than 265 mutations and 38 polymorphisms
      (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ncl) have been described. Other NCL genes are
      hypothesized, including CLN4 and CLN9; CLCN6, CLCN7 and possibly SGSH are
      under study. Some therapeutic strategies applied to other LSDs with
      significant systemic involvement would not be effective in NCLs due to the
      necessity of passing the blood brain barrier to prevent the
      neurodegeneration, repair or restore the CNS functionality. There are
      therapies for the NCLs currently at preclinical stages and under phase 1
      trials to establish safety in affected children. These approaches involve
      enzyme replacement, gene therapy, neural stem cell replacement, immune
      therapy and other pharmacological approaches. In the next decade, progress
      in the understanding of the natural history and the biochemical and
      molecular cascade of events relevant to the pathogenesis of these diseases
      in humans and animal models will be required to achieve significant
      therapeutic advances.

TI  - Current Status of Therapy Developments for Niemann - Pick Type C Disease.
AB  - Niemann-Pick disease type C is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by
      mutations in either one of the two genes, NPC1 or NPC2, which encode
      proteins involved in the regulation of normal transport and/or processing
      of free cholesterol. Several types of lipids including free cholesterol
      (unesterified), sphingosine, sphingomyelin, phospholipids and
      glycosphingolipids (glucosylceramide and gangliosides GM2 and GM3) are
      accumulated in lysosomes and late endosomes of cells, with pronounced
      concentrations in the liver and the spleen. The key laboratory diagnostic
      test for NP-C is filliping staining of cultured skin fibroblasts from the
      patient, to demonstrate free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes
      secondary to impaired intracellular cholesterol transport. The
      symptomatology and rate of disease progression are strongly influenced by
      age at disease onset and different clinical forms have been described on
      this basis: Perinatal, Early-infantile (EI), late-infantile (LI), juvenile
      and adult forms. Clinical symptoms include progressive neurological
      deterioration and visceral organomegaly. Nowadays there is no fully
      effective treatment, only supportive measures for relief of specific
      manifestations of the disease. The intervention to slow disease
      progression is the most promising therapy. A number of experimental
      disease - specific therapies, based on the molecular pathology of NP-C,
      have been tested in cell culture and animal models including
      neurosteroids, cholesterol - binding agents, curcumin and Miglustat. This
      paper summarizes the recent developments that have been investigated for
      the treatment in patients and animal models with NPC. Current therapeutic
      approaches have been classified based on the targeting of cellular
      function, the anti - apoptotic cellular mechanisms and the stem cells
      therapy.

TI  - Discovery of allosteric inhibitors of kinesin spindle protein (KSP) for
      the treatment of taxane-refractory cancer: MK-0731 and analogs.
PG  - 697-712
AB  - Current cancer chemotherapy relies heavily on cytotoxic agents, such as
      the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids, that interfere with the cellular
      machinery required for cell division and divert the cell down a pathway of
      programmed cell death. These antimitotic agents, or spindle poisons,
      target the mitotic spindle by binding to tubulin, a protein required not
      only for mitosis but also for structural integrity and proper function of
      healthy, terminally differentiated cells. To avoid side effects attributed
      to this nonselective mechanism of action, new targets in the mitotic
      pathway that act only in dividing cells were sought and a leading
      candidate to emerge from these efforts was kinesin spindle protein (KSP or
      HsEg5). KSP is a molecular motor protein that is expressed only during
      mitosis and controls the formation of a functional mitotic spindle.
      Inhibition of KSP causes mitotic arrest followed by cell death in
      malignant cells and thus has the potential to become a novel
      chemotherapeutic strategy with the potential for reduced toxicity. This
      article summarizes efforts carried out at Merck to discover potent,
      selective and water soluble KSP inhibitors that culminated in the
      discovery of MK-0731, the second KSP inhibitor to enter clinical trials.
      Of special focus in this article is how an HTS lead was optimized in
      apparently divergent directions, but these disparate leads converged in
      the design of compounds that overcame P-glycoprotein efflux and hERG
      channel activity, two issues that required considerable optimization
      within our program.

TI  - Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with High-Risk Disease: A Review
      of Short-Term Outcomes from a High-Volume Center.
AB  - Abstract Purpose: Patients with high-risk prostate cancer have
      historically been treated with multimodal therapy and considered poor
      candidates for minimally invasive surgery. We reviewed our experiences
      with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in patients with
      high-risk clinical features. Materials and Methods: Clinical database
      review identified high-risk patients undergoing RARP by two high-volume
      robotic surgeons. D'Amico's criteria for high-risk prostate cancer were
      utilized: prostate-specific antigen &gt;/=20 ng/mL, clinical stage &gt;/=T2c, or
      preoperative Gleason grade &gt;/=8. About 148 patients were identified in the
      study group. Mean age at surgery was 60.9 years, and mean body mass index
      was 27.9. Mean estimated blood loss was 150 cc and the transfusion rate
      was 2.7%. Median hospital stay was 1 day and the rate of major
      complications (Clavien grade &gt;/=3) was 3.4%. Results: Bilateral nerve
      preservation was feasible in 28.4%, and the rate of positive surgical
      margins was 20.9%. Final pathology demonstrated extra-capsular disease in
      54.1% of patients and 12.3% had lymph node involvement. At 2 years of
      follow-up, 21.3% of patients had experienced biochemical recurrence or had
      persistent disease after treatment. Continence was 91.2% (1 pad or less)
      and total impotence (inability to masturbate) was 48.3%. Conclusions: RARP
      does not compromise oncologic or functional outcomes in patients with
      high-risk prostate cancer. Although long-term study is necessary to
      validate oncologic and functional outcomes, our data suggest that the
      presence of high-risk disease is not a contraindication to a minimally
      invasive approach for radical prostatectomy at experienced centers.

TI  - Observation of Pain Control in Patients with Bisphosphonate-Induced
      Osteonecrosis Using Low Level Laser Therapy: Preliminary Results.
AB  - Abstract Background: Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw
      (BRONJ) is an adverse side effect associated with bisphosphonate (BP)
      therapy, especially when parenteral BP administration is used. Patients
      affected by BRONJ present wide areas of exposed necrotic bone,
      particularly after surgical oral procedures. The main symptom is pain that
      is poorly controlled by common analgesic drugs. Recently, many studies
      have pointed to the beneficial effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in
      pain reduction for many pathological conditions. The purpose of this study
      is to investigate whether LLLT could be helpful in managing BRONJ by
      reducing the problems associated with this condition and the use of
      analgesic drugs. Methods: Twelve patients affected by BRONJ were monitored
      at the Complex Operative Unit of Oral Pathology. Among these patients,
      only seven referred to pain in necrotic areas and were recruited for LLLT.
      Laser applications were performed with a double diode laser simultaneously
      emitting at two different wavelengths (lambda = 650 nm and lambda =
      904-910 nm, spot size = 8 mm). All of the patients were irradiated with a
      fluence of 0.053 J/cm(2) for 15 min five times over a period of 2 weeks,
      in a non-contact mode,  approximately 1 mm from the pathologic area. The
      patient's maximum and minimum pain was recorded using a numeric rating
      scale (NRS) evaluation before and after the treatment. Statistical
      analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Six
      patients showed significant pain reduction, and only one patient indicated
      a worsening of the symptoms, which was probably related to a reinfection
      of the BRONJ site, which occurred during the study. A statistically
      significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) was found between the NRS rates before
      and after the protocol. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that LLLT
      may be a valid technique to support the treatment of BRONJ-related pain,
      even though the low number of cases in this study does not permit any
      conclusive consideration.

TI  - ULK1, mTor and Mitochondria: Linking Nutrient Availability and Autophagy.
AB  - A fundamental function of autophagy conserved from yeast to mammals is
      mobilization of macromolecules during times of limited nutrient
      availability, permitting organisms to survive under starvation conditions.
      In yeast, autophagy is initiated following nitrogen or carbon deprivation,
      and autophagy mutants die rapidly under these conditions. Similarly, in
      mammals, autophagy is upregulated in most organs following initiation of
      starvation, and is critical for survival in the perinatal period following
      abrupt termination of the placental nutrient supply. The nutrient-sensing
      kinase, mTor, coordinates cellular proliferation and growth with nutrient
      availability, at least in part by regulating protein synthesis and
      autophagy-mediated degradation. In this review, I will focus on the
      regulation of autophagy by mTor and Ulk1, a mammalian homologue of Atg1,
      in response to changes in nutrient availability. Given the importance of
      mitochondria in maintaining bioenergetic homestasis, and potentially as a
      source of membrane for autophagosomes during starvation, I will also
      discuss possible roles for mitochondria in this process.

TI  - Role of Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor in Angiotensin II-Induced Cytokine
      Production in Macrophages.
AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of angiotensin
      II (Ang II) on the expression of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor and to
      characterize the mechanism underlying AT1 receptor promotion of
      inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The RAW 264.7
      cells were stimulated with various concentrations of Ang II for different
      times. The mRNA and protein expressions of AT1 receptor in the cells were
      determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western
      blot analysis, respectively. The macrophages secretion of proinflammatory
      cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6,
      and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and generation of ROS (by flow
      cytometry) were also examined. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and
      activator protein-1 (AP-1) activities were determined by electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay. Ang II resulted in an upregulation of AT1 receptor
      expression in dose- and time-dependent manners in macrophages. Ang II not
      only induced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta,
      IL-6, and IL-10 but also increased the release of ROS. Further, both
      NF-kappaB and AP-1 were activated after stimulation with Ang II. However,
      these events were all abolished by preincubation with ZD7155, a selective
      competitive antagonist for the AT1 receptor. These results suggest that
      the AT1 receptor plays an important role in Ang II-induced cytokines
      production and ROS release via NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways in macrophages.

TI  - Gene Regulatory and Clinical Effects of Interferon beta in Patients with
      Metastatic Melanoma: A Phase II Trial.
AB  - Interferon (IFN)-beta in preclinical studies, compared to IFN-alpha2,
      bound with higher affinity to its receptor, induced to higher levels of
      IFN-stimulated gene products, induced more apoptosis in melanoma cells,
      and had antitumor effects against melanoma. A maximally tolerated dose of
      12 x 10(6) international units/m(2) after 2 weeks subcutaneously daily
      with dose escalation to 18 x 10(6) international units/m(2) was thus used
      in a phase II trial of IFN-beta1a in cutaneous metastatic melanoma (n =
      17) and uveal melanoma (n = 4). It resulted in expected but reversible
      drug-related severe (grade 3) adverse events in 13/21 patients; anorexia
      and fatigue were mostly of mild or moderate severity and infrequently
      needed dose reduction. Although a single patient had a sustained
      regression, overall IFN-beta1a did not have clinical benefit (response
      rate &lt;10%; median progression-free survival 1.8 months). Effective and
      potent induction in peripheral blood cells and into serum of products of
      IFN-stimulated genes such as the pro-apoptotic cytokine, TRAIL, and the
      immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic chemokines, CXCL10 and CCL8,
      confirmed gene regulatory actions. To probe further anti-angiogenic
      mechanisms, both VEGF-A and CXCL-5 were assessed; compared to before
      treatment, both proteins decreased. Continued improvements in
      understanding of antitumor mechanisms will enhance usefulness of IFNs for
      nodal or distant metastases from melanoma.

TI  - Clinical progression of X-linked muscular dystrophy in two German
      Shorthaired Pointers.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION: 2 full-sibling male German Shorthaired Pointer (GSHP)
      puppies (dogs 1 and 2) with X-linked muscular dystrophy and deletion of
      the dystrophin gene (gene symbol, DMD) each had poor growth, skeletal
      muscle atrophy, pelvic limb weakness, episodic collapse, and episodes of
      coughing. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Initial examination revealed stunted growth,
      brachygnathism, trismus, and diffuse neuromuscular signs in each puppy;
      clinical signs were more severe in dog 2 than in dog 1.
      Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a lack of dystrophin protein in both
      dogs. During the next 3 years, each dog developed hyperinflation of the
      lungs, hypertrophy of the cervical musculature, and hypertrophy of the
      lateral head of the triceps brachii muscle. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME:
      Monitoring and supportive care were provided at follow-up visits during an
      approximately 7-year period. No other specific treatment was provided.
      Neuromuscular signs in both dogs remained stable after 3 years of age,
      with dog 2 consistently more severely affected than dog 1. The dogs had
      multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia; dogs 1 and 2 were euthanatized
      at 84 and 93 months of age, respectively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The clinical
      course of disease in these dogs was monitored for a longer period than has
      been monitored in previous reports of dystrophin-deficient dogs. The
      clinical progression of muscular dystrophy in the 2 GSHPs was compared
      with that for other breeds and species with dystrophin-deficient
      conditions, and the potential basis for the phenotypic variation observed
      between these littermates, along with potential therapeutic ramifications
      for dogs and humans, was evaluated.

TI  - Astrocytic Redox Remodeling by Amyloid beta Peptide.
AB  - Astrocytes are critical for neuronal redox homeostasis providing them with
      cysteine needed for glutathione [GSH] synthesis. In this study, we
      demonstrate that the astrocytic redox response signature provoked by
      amyloid beta [Abeta] is distinct from that of a general oxidant
      [tertiary-butylhydroperoxide [t-BuOOH]]. Acute Abeta treatment increased
      cystathionine beta-synthase [CBS] levels and enhanced transsulfuration
      flux in contrast to repeated Abeta exposure, which decreased CBS and
      catalase protein levels. Although t-BuOOH also increased transsulfuration
      flux, CBS levels were unaffected. The net effect of Abeta treatment was an
      oxidative shift in the intracellular GSH/glutathione disulfide redox
      potential in contrast to a reductive shift in response to peroxide. In the
      extracellular compartment, Abeta but not t-BuOOH, enhanced cystine uptake
      and cysteine accumulation, and resulted in remodeling of the extracellular
      cysteine/cystine redox potential in the reductive direction. The redox
      changes elicited by Abeta but not peroxide were associated with enhanced
      DNA synthesis. CBS activity and protein levels tended to be lower in
      cerebellum from Alzheimer's disease [AD] patients compared to age-matched
      controls. Our study suggests that the alterations in astrocytic redox
      status could compromise the neuroprotective potential of astrocytes and
      may be a potential new target for therapeutic intervention in AD.

TI  - The Chemistry of Nitroxyl (HNO) Releasing Compounds.
AB  - Nitroxyl (HNO) demonstrates a diverse and unique biological profile
      compared to nitric oxide, a redox related compound. While numerous studies
      support the use of HNO as a therapeutic agent, the inherent chemical
      reactivity of HNO requires the use of donor molecules. Two general
      chemical strategies currently exist for HNO generation from
      nitrogen-containing molecules: 1) the disproportionation of hydroxylamine
      derivatives containing good leaving groups attached to the nitrogen atom
      and 2) the decomposition of nitroso compounds (X-N=O, where X represents a
      good leaving group). This review summarizes the synthesis and structure,
      the HNO releasing mechanisms, kinetics and by-product formation, and
      alternative reactions of six major groups of HNO donors: Angeli's salt,
      Piloty's acid and its derivatives, cyanamide, diazenium diolate-derived
      compounds, acyl nitroso compounds and acyloxy nitroso compounds. A large
      body of work exists defining these six groups of HNO donors and the
      overall chemistry of each donor requires consideration in light of its
      ability to produce HNO. The increasing interest in HNO biology and the
      potential of HNO-based therapeutics presents exciting opportunities to
      further develop HNO donors as both research tools and potential
      treatments.

TI  - Comparison of Gingival Crevicular Fluid Sampling Methods in Patients With
      Severe Chronic Periodontitis.
AB  - Background: Analysis of samplings from periodontal pockets is important in
      diagnosis and therapy control of periodontitis. In this study, three
      different sampling techniques were compared to determine if one method can
      yield samples suitable for reproducible and simultaneous determination of
      bacterial load, cytokines, neutrophil elastase, and Arg-specific
      gingipains. R-gingipains are an important virulence factor of
      Porphyromonas gingivalis, the exact concentration of which in gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) has not yet been quantified. Methods: GCF was
      sampled from four sites per patient (each two sites one method) in 36
      chronic periodontitis patients. One week later, the procedure was repeated
      with alternative methods. The variables that had been determined were:
      loads of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, levels
      of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, activity of neutrophil elastase and
      level of R-gingipains. Results: The detected cytokine levels were higher
      using paper strips compared to paper points. Bacteria were found in
      similar loads from the paper strips and paper points. R-gingipains were
      detectable in high quantities only by washing of the periodontal pocket.
      The level of R-gingipains correlated with the load of P. gingivalis.
      Conclusion: The use of paper strips is suitable for simultaneous
      determination of microbial and immunological parameters. Obtaining GCF by
      washing can be useful for special purposes. Gingipain concentration in
      periodontal pockets was directly determined to be up to 1.5 muM. This
      value indicates that most of so far identified substrates of these
      proteases by in vitro assays can be easily degraded in P. gingivalis
      infected sites.

TI  - Enhancement of wound healing by secretory factors of endothelial precursor
      cells derived from human embryonic stem cells.
PG  - 165-78
AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Stem cells have been shown to have a therapeutic effect
      in several ischemic animal models, including hindlimb ischemia and chronic
      wound. We examined the wound-healing effect of secretory factors released
      by human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived endothelial precursor cells
      (EPC) in cutaneous excisional wound models. METHODS: hESC-EPC were sorted
      by CD133/KDR, and endothelial characteristics were confirmed by reverse
      transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Matrigel assay and
      ac-LDL uptake. Conditioned medium (CM) of hESC-EPC was prepared, and
      concentrated hESC-EPC CM was applied in a mouse excisional wound model.
      RESULTS: hESC-EPC CM accelerated wound healing and increased the tensile
      strength of wounds after topical treatment and subcutaneous injection. In
      addition, hESC-EPC CM treatment caused more rapid re-formation of
      granulation tissue and re-epithelialization of wounds compared with
      control vehicle medium and CB-EPC CM-treated wounds. In vitro, hESC-EPC CM
      significantly improved the proliferation and migration of dermal
      fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. hESC-EPC CM also increased the
      extracellular matrix synthesis of fibroblasts. Analysis of hESC-EPC CM
      with a multiplex cytokine array system indicated that hESC-EPC secreted
      distinctively different cytokines and chemokines, such as epidermal growth
      factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), fractalkine,
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin
      (IL)-6, IL-8, platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) and vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are well known to be important in
      normal angiogenesis and wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: This study has
      demonstrated the wound-healing effect of hESC-EPC CM and characterized the
      spectrum of cytokines released by hESC-EPC that are functionally involved
      in the wound-healing process. These results suggest that secretory factors
      released from stem cells could be an important mediator of stem cell
      therapy in ischemic tissue diseases.

TI  - The color purple: from royalty to laboratory, with apologies to
      Malachowski.
PG  - 7-35
AB  - The components of the blood stain, eosin and methylene blue, were
      introduced by Baeyer and Caro, respectively. Methylene blue was used
      primarily for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis until Ehrlich in 1880
      mixed methylene blue with acid fuchsin to produce what he termed a
      &quot;neutral stain,&quot; which allowed differentiation of blood cells. Eight years
      later, Checin ski changed the acidic component of the dye to eosin. Plehn
      subsequently altered the proportions of eosin and methylene blue to
      produce a greater range of red and blue hues. In 1891, Malachowski and
      Romanowsky independently developed stains composed of eosin and &quot;ripened&quot;
      methylene blue that not only differentiated blood cells, but also
      demonstrated the nuclei of malarial parasites. A number of &quot;ripening&quot; or
      &quot;polychroming&quot; techniques were investigated by different groups, but the
      aqueous dye solutions produced were unstable and precipitated rapidly.
      Subsequently, methanol was introduced as a solvent for the dye precipitate
      and techniques were developed that utilized the fixative properties of the
      methanolic solution prior to aqueous dilution for staining. This avoided
      the troublesome process of heat fixation of blood films. Giemsa further
      improved these techniques by using more controlled methods of methylene
      blue demethylation. In addition, he used measured amounts of known dyes
      and increased dye stability by adding glycerol to the methanol solvent.
      With the outbreak of World War I, it became difficult to obtain German
      dyes outside of Germany; during the World War II, it became impossible. In
      their effort to improve the inferior American versions of Giemsa's stain,
      Lillie, Roe, and Wilcox discovered that the best staining results were
      obtained using pure methylene blue, one of its breakdown products (azure
      B) and eosin. These three substituents remain the major components of the
      stain to this day.

TI  - Cycloaddition reactions of allenylphosphonates and related allenes with
      dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates, 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran, and
      anthracene.
PG  - 920-38
AB  - Cycloaddition reactions of allenylphosphonates [(RO)(2)P(O)[(R(1))C
      horizontal lineC horizontal lineCR(2)(2)] with dialkyl
      acetylenedicarboxylates, 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran, and anthracene have
      been investigated and compared with those of allenoates [(EtO(2)C)RC
      horizontal lineC horizontal lineCH(2)] and allenylphosphine oxides
      [Ph(2)P(O)(R(1))C horizontal lineC horizontal lineCR(2)(2)] in selected
      cases. Allenylphosphonates (RO)(2)P(O)(Ar)C horizontal lineC horizontal
      lineCH(2) with an alpha-aryl group preferentially undergo [4 + 2]
      cycloaddition with DMAD/DEAD under thermal activation, but in addition to
      the expected 1:1 (allene: DMAD) product, the reaction also leads to 1:2 as
      well as 2:1 products that were not reported before. When an extra vinyl
      group is present at the gamma-carbon of allenylphosphonate [e.g.,
      (OCH(2)CMe(2)CH(2)O)P(O)(Ph)C horizontal lineC horizontal lineCH(C
      horizontal lineCHMe)], [4 + 2] cycloaddition takes place utilizing either
      the vinylic or the aryl end, but additionally a novel cyclization wherein
      complete opening of the [beta,gamma] carbon-carbon double bond of the
      allene is realized. In contrast to these, the reaction of
      allenylphosphonate (OCH(2)CMe(2)CH(2)O)P(O)(H)C horizontal lineC
      horizontal lineCMe(2) possessing a terminal  horizontal lineCMe(2) group
      with DMAD occurs by both [2 + 2] cycloaddition and ene reaction. While the
      reaction of  horizontal lineCH(2) terminal allenylphosphonates as well as
      allenylphosphine oxides with 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran afforded
      preferentially endo-[4 + 2] cycloaddition products via [alpha,beta]
      attack, the analogous allenoates [(EtO(2)C)RC horizontal lineC horizontal
      lineCH(2)] underwent exo-[4 + 2] cyclization. Under similar conditions,
      allenylphosphonates with a terminal  horizontal lineCR(2) group gave only
      [beta,gamma]-cycloaddition products. An unusual ring-opening of a [4 + 2]
      cycloaddition product followed by ring-closing via [4 + 4] cycloaddition,
      as revealed by (31)P NMR spectroscopy, is reported. Anthracene reacted in
      a manner similar to 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran, albeit with lower
      reactivity. Key products, including a set of exo- and endo- [4 + 2]
      cycloaddition products, have been characterized by single crystal X-ray
      crystallography.

TI  - Effect of Inclining Strain on the Crystal Lattice along an Extended Series
      of Lanthanide Hydroxysulfates Ln(OH)SO(4) (Ln = Pr-Yb, except Pm).
PG  - 836-46
AB  - A series of trivalent lanthanide hydroxysulfates, Ln(OH)SO(4), (Ln = Pr
      through Yb, except radioactive Pm) has been synthesized via hydrothermal
      methods from Ln(2)(SO(4))(3).8H(2)O by reaction with aqueous NaOH at 170 
      degrees C in Teflon lined Parr steel autoclaves, and were characterized by
      single crystal X-ray diffraction and FT-IR spectroscopy. Two types of
      arrangements were found in the solid state. The lighter (Ln = Pr-Nd,
      Sm-Gd) and heavier lanthanide(III) hydroxysulfates (Tb-Yb) are each
      isostructural. Both structure types exhibit the monoclinic space group
      P2(1)/n, but the unit cell content is doubled with two
      crystallographically distinct LnO(8) polyhedra for the heavier lanthanide
      compounds. The lighter complexes maintain the coordination number 9,
      forming a three-dimensional extended lattice. The heavier counterparts
      exhibit the coordination number 8, and arrange as infinite columns of two
      crystallographically different LnO(8) polyhedra, while extending along the
      &quot;c&quot; axis. These columns of LnO(8) polyhedra are surrounded and separated
      by six columns of sulfate ions, also elongating in the &quot;c&quot; direction. The
      rigid sulfate entities seem to obstruct the closing in of the lighter
      LnO(9) polyhedra, and show an inclining degree of torsion into the &quot;ac&quot;
      layers. The crystal lattice of the lighter 4f complexes can sufficiently
      withstand the tension buildup, caused by the decreasing Ln(3+) radius, up
      to Gd(OH)SO(4). The energy profile of this structural arrangement then
      seems to exceed levels at which this structure type is favorable. The
      lattice arrangement of the heavier Ln-analogues seems to offer a lower
      energy profile. This appears to be the preferred arrangement for the
      heavier lanthanide hydroxysulfates, whose crystal lattice exhibits more
      flexibility, as the coordination sphere of these analogues is less
      crowded. The IR absorbance frequencies of the hydroxide ligands correlate
      as a function of the Ln(3+) ionic radius. This corresponds well with the
      X-ray single crystal analysis data.

      Wood Smoke Particulate Matter in Human A549 and THP-1 Cell Lines.
PG  - 168-184
AB  - Combustion of biomass and wood for residential heating and/or cooking
      contributes substantially to both ambient air and indoor levels of
      particulate matter (PM). Toxicological characterization of ambient air PM,
      especially related to traffic, is well advanced, whereas the toxicology of
      wood smoke PM (WSPM) is poorly assessed. We assessed a wide spectrum of
      toxicity end points in human A549 lung epithelial and THP-1 monocytic cell
      lines comparing WSPM from high or low oxygen combustion and ambient PM
      collected in a village with many operating wood stoves and from a rural
      background area. In both cell types, all extensively characterized PM
      samples (1.25-100 mug/mL) induced dose-dependent formation of reactive
      oxygen species and DNA damage in terms of strand breaks and
      formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase sites assessed by the comet assay with
      WSPM being most potent. The WSPM contained more polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAH), less soluble metals, and expectedly also had a smaller
      particle size than PM collected from ambient air. All four types of PM
      combined increased the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine
      dose-dependently in A549 cells, whereas there was no change in the levels
      of etheno-adducts or bulky DNA adducts. Furthermore, mRNA expression of
      the proinflammatory genes monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,
      interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha as well as the oxidative
      stress gene heme oxygenase-1 was upregulated in the THP-1 cells especially
      by WSPM and ambient PM sampled from the wood stove area. Expression of
      oxoguanine glycosylase 1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, and
      interleukin-6 did not change. We conclude that WSPM has small particle
      size, high level of PAH, low level of water-soluble metals, and produces
      high levels of free radicals, DNA damage as well as inflammatory and
      oxidative stress response gene expression in cultured human cells.

TI  - Experimental and Modeling Studies of the Pressure and Temperature
      Dependences of the Kinetics and the OH Yields in the Acetyl + O(2)
      Reaction.
PG  - 1069-85
AB  - The acetyl + O(2) reaction has been studied by observing the time
      dependence of OH by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and by electronic
      structure/master equation analysis. The experimental OH time profiles were
      analyzed to obtain the kinetics of the acetyl + O(2) reaction and the
      relative OH yields over the temperature range of 213-500 K in helium at
      pressures in the range of 5-600 Torr. More limited measurements were made
      in N(2) and for CD(3)CO + O(2). The relative OH yields were converted into
      absolute yields by assuming that the OH yield at zero pressure is unity.
      Electronic structure calculations of the stationary points of the
      potential energy surface were used with a master equation analysis to fit
      the experimental data in He using the high-pressure limiting rate
      coefficient for the reaction, k(infinity)(T), and the energy transfer
      parameter, DeltaE(d), as variable parameters. The best-fit parameters
      obtained are k(infinity) = 6.2 x 10(-12) cm(-3) molecule(-1) s(-1),
      independent of temperature over the experimental range, and DeltaE(d)(He)
      = 160(T/298 K) cm(-1). The fits in N(2), using the same k(infinity)(T),
      gave DeltaE(d)(N(2)) = 270(T/298 K) cm(-1). The rate coefficients for
      formation of OH and CH(3)C(O)O(2) are provided in parametrized form, based
      on modified Troe expressions, from the best-fit master equation
      calculations, over the pressure and temperature ranges of 1 &lt;/= p/Torr &lt;/=
      1.5 x 10(5) and 200 &lt;/= T/K &lt;/= 1000 for He and N(2) as the bath gas. The
      minor channels, leading to HO(2) + CH(2)CO and CH(2)C(O)OOH, generally
      have yields &lt;1% over this range.

TI  - Homogeneous ice nucleation from aqueous inorganic/organic particles
      representative of biomass burning: water activity, freezing temperatures,
      nucleation rates.
PG  - 762-73
AB  - Homogeneous ice nucleation plays an important role in the formation of
      cirrus clouds with subsequent effects on the global radiative budget. Here
      we report on homogeneous ice nucleation temperatures and corresponding
      nucleation rate coefficients of aqueous droplets serving as surrogates of
      biomass burning aerosol. Micrometer-sized (NH(4))(2)SO(4)/levoglucosan
      droplets with mass ratios of 10:1, 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 and aqueous
      multicomponent organic droplets with and without (NH(4))(2)SO(4) under
      typical tropospheric temperatures and relative humidities are investigated
      experimentally using a droplet conditioning and ice nucleation apparatus
      coupled to an optical microscope with image analysis. Homogeneous freezing
      was determined as a function of temperature and water activity, a(w),
      which was set at droplet preparation conditions. The ice nucleation data
      indicate that minor addition of (NH(4))(2)SO(4) to the aqueous organic
      droplets renders the temperature dependency of water activity negligible
      in contrast to the case of aqueous organic solution droplets. The mean
      homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficient derived from 8 different
      aqueous droplet compositions with average diameters of  approximately 60
      mum for temperatures as low as 195 K and a(w) of 0.82-1 is 2.18 x 10(6)
      cm(-3) s(-1). The experimentally derived freezing temperatures and
      homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients are in agreement with
      predictions of the water activity-based homogeneous ice nucleation theory
      when taking predictive uncertainties into account. However, the presented
      ice nucleation data indicate that the water activity-based homogeneous ice
      nucleation theory overpredicts the freezing temperatures by up to 3 K and
      corresponding ice nucleation rate coefficients by up to  approximately 2
      orders of magnitude. A shift of 0.01 in a(w), which is well within the
      uncertainty of typical field and laboratory relative humidity
      measurements, brings experimental and predicted freezing temperatures and
      homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients into agreement. The
      experimentally derived ice nucleation data are applied to constrain the
      water activity-based homogeneous ice nucleation theory to smaller than
      +/-1 order of magnitude compared to the predictive uncertainty of larger
      than +/-6 orders of magnitude. The atmospheric implications of these
      findings are discussed.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Steroidal Glycosides in Different Organs of
      Easter Lily ( Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) by LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 995-1004
AB  - The bulbs of the Easter lily ( Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) are regularly
      consumed in Asia as both food and medicine, and the beautiful white
      flowers are appreciated worldwide as an attractive ornamental. The Easter
      lily is a rich source of steroidal glycosides, a group of compounds that
      may be responsible for some of the traditional medicinal uses of lilies.
      Since the appearance of recent reports on the role steroidal glycosides in
      animal and human health, there is increasing interest in the concentration
      of these natural products in plant-derived foods. A LC-MS/MS method
      performed in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used for the
      quantitative analysis of two steroidal glycoalkaloids and three furostanol
      saponins, in the different organs of L. longiflorum. The highest
      concentrations of the total five steroidal glycosides were 12.02 +/- 0.36,
      10.09 +/- 0.23, and 9.36 +/- 0.27 mg/g dry weight in flower buds, lower
      stems, and leaves, respectively. The highest concentrations of the two
      steroidal glycoalkaloids were 8.49 +/- 0.3, 6.91 +/- 0.22, and 5.83 +/-
      0.15 mg/g dry weight in flower buds, leaves, and bulbs, respectively. In
      contrast, the highest concentrations of the three furostanol saponins were
      4.87 +/- 0.13, 4.37 +/- 0.07, and 3.53 +/- 0.06 mg/g dry weight in lower
      stems, fleshy roots, and flower buds, respectively. The steroidal
      glycoalkaloids were detected in higher concentrations as compared to the
      furostanol saponins in all of the plant organs except the roots. The ratio
      of the steroidal glycoalkaloids to furostanol saponins was higher in the
      plant organs exposed to light and decreased in proportion from the
      aboveground organs to the underground organs. Additionally, histological
      staining of bulb scales revealed differential furostanol accumulation in
      the basal plate, bulb scale epidermal cells, and vascular bundles, with
      little or no staining in the mesophyll of the bulb scale. An understanding
      of the distribution of steroidal glycosides in the different organs of L.
      longiflorum is the first step in developing insight into the role these
      compounds play in plant biology and chemical ecology and aids in the
      development of extraction and purification methodologies for food, health,
      and industrial applications. In the present study,

TI  - Fetal Exposure to Chlordane and Permethrin Mixtures in Relation to
      Inflammatory Cytokines and Birth Outcomes.
AB  - We sought to characterize the relationships between cord serum
      concentrations of chlordane and permethrin pesticides, inflammatory
      cytokines, gestational age, and size at birth. Umbilical cord serum levels
      of trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, cis- and trans-permethrin, piperonyl
      butoxide, and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,
      IL-10, IL-12p70, GMCSF) were quantified in 300 newborns at the Johns
      Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD (2004-2005). Principal component
      analyses were used to quantitate chlordane and permethrin mixtures and to
      identify independent cytokine components. Five cytokine components
      described 87% of the variance in cord serum cytokine levels; these (and
      predominant loadings) were as follows: (1) all 9 cytokines; (2) acute
      phase (IL-1beta, IL-6); (3) anti-inflammatory (IL-10); (4) TNF-alpha; and
      (5) IL-1beta. Of these, the TNF-alpha component was significantly
      associated with a 2-day decrease in gestational age. Chlordane was
      associated with lower levels of the pro-inflammatory IL-1beta [beta: -0.11
      (-0.20, -0.02)]. Permethrin was negatively associated with the
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [beta: -0.14 (-0.22, -0.05)]. Neither
      pesticides nor cytokines were significantly associated with birthweight,
      length, or head circumference, and pesticides were not associated with
      gestational age. Our findings suggest that chlordane and permethrin
      concentrations in cord blood may be associated with levels of inflammatory
      cytokines in the fetus.

TI  - Characterization of mechanochemical treated fly ash from a medical waste
      incinerator.
PG  - 1643-8
AB  - The mechanochemical treatment of fly ash generated from a medical waste
      incinerator was subjected to grinding for 2 hr at 400 r/min in a planetary
      ball mill. The treated fly ash was characterized by a suite of analytical
      methods including High Resolution Gas Chromatograph/High Resolution Mass
      Spectrometer, Mastersizer 2000 Particle Size Analyzer, QUADRASORB SI
      Surface Area Analyzer, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray diffraction.
      Results showed that abatement efficiency of polychlorinated
      dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDDs/Fs) in terms of
      total concentration averagely amount to 76% which was relatively higher
      than that of I-TEQ concentration averagely amount to 56%; the most
      concentration of toxic congeners as well as isomers of PCDDs/Fs decreased
      after mechanochemical treatment. The treated fly ash was characterized by
      a more homogeneous distribution of concaves as well as the significant
      decreasing in overall particle size and great enlargement in surface area.
      The major crystallization phases or intensities were considerably changed
      by mechanochemical treatment, of which a new phase containing chlorine
      formed may be a possible factor suggesting chlorination reaction occurring
      on the crystalline surface.

TI  - Removal of elemental mercury by iodine-modified rice husk ash sorbents.
PG  - 1629-36
AB  - Iodine-modified calcium-based rice husk ash sorbents (I2/CaO/RHA) were
      synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence,
      and N2 isotherm adsorption/desorption. Adsorption experiments of
      vapor-phase elemental mercury (Hg0) were performed in a laboratory-scale
      fixed-bed reactor. I2/CaO/RHA performances on Hg0 adsorption were compared
      with those of modified Ca-based fly ash sorbents (I2/CaO/FA) and modified
      fly ash sorbents (I2/FA). Effects of oxidant loading, supports, pore size
      distribution, iodine impregnation modes, and temperature were investigated
      as well to understand the mechanism in capturing Hg0. The modified
      sorbents exhibited reasonable efficiency for Hg0 removal under simulated
      flue gas. The surface area, pore size distribution, and iodine
      impregnation modes of the sorbents did not produce a strong effect on Hg0
      capture efficiency, while fair correlation was observed between Hg0 uptake
      capacity and iodine concentration. Therefore, the content of I2
      impregnated on the sorbents was identified as the most important factor
      influencing the capacity of these sorbents for Hg0 uptake. Increasing
      temperature in the range of 80-140 degrees C caused a rise in Hg0 removal.
      A reaction mechanism that may explain the experimental results was
      presumed based on the characterizations and adsorption study.

      2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid, nitrobenzene and oxalic acid in
      water.
PG  - 1623-8
AB  - Fe3O4-CoO/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation
      using Fe(NO3)3 x 9H2O and Co(NO3)2 x 6H2O as the precursors, and its
      catalytic performance was investigated in ozonation of
      2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (2,4-DP), nitrobenzene and oxalic
      acid. The experimental results indicated that Fe3O4-CoO/Al2O3 catalyst
      enabled an interesting improvement of ozonation efficiency during the
      degradation of each organic pollutant, and the Fe3O4-CoO/Al2O3 catalytic
      ozonation system followed a radical-type mechanism. The kinetics of
      ozonation alone and Fe3O4-CoO/Al2O3 catalytic ozonation of three organic
      pollutants in aqueous solution were discussed under the mere consideration
      of direct ozone reaction and OH radical reaction to well investigate its
      performance. In the catalytic ozonation of 2,4-DP, the apparent reaction
      rate constants (k) were determined to be 1.456 x 10(-2) min(-1) for
      ozonation alone and 4.740 x 10(-2) min(-1) for O3/Fe3O4-CoO/Al203. And
      O3/Fe3O4-CoO/Al2O3 had a larger R(ct) (6.614 x 10(-9)) calculated by the
      relative method than O3 did (1.800 x 10(-9)), showing O3/Fe3O4-CoO/Al2O3
      generated more hydroxyl radical. Similar results were also obtained in the
      catalytic ozonation of nitrobenzene and oxalic acid. The above results
      demonstrated that the catalytic performance of Fe3O4-CoO/Al2O3 in
      ozonation of studied organic substance was universal to a certain degree.

TI  - Capture of carbon dioxide by amine-impregnated as-synthesized MCM-41.
PG  - 1558-63
AB  - The novel carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorbents with a high capture efficiency
      were prepared through impregnating the as-synthesized MCM-41 with three
      kinds of amines, namely diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine
      (TETA) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). The resultant samples were
      characterized by small angle X-ray diffraction and low temperature N2
      adsorption. The synthesis way not only saves the energy or extractor to
      remove the template but also is environmentally friendly due to the
      absence of the potential pollutants such as toluene. CO2 capture was
      investigated in a dynamic packed column. The sample impregnated by TETA
      showed the highest adsorption capacity, approximately 2.22 mmol/g at 60
      degrees C due to its highest amino-groups content among the three amines.
      The CO2 adsorption behavior was also investigated with the deactivation
      model, which showed an excellent prediction for the breakthrough curves.

PG  - 1826-32
AB  - The active biomonitoring (ABM) approach was investigated using species of
      indigenous (from a pristine site) and transplanted (to a polluted area)
      fish Carassius auratus as an indicator organism of water/sediment
      pollution in Taihu Lake, a highly urbanized and industrialized area. The
      biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), reduced
      glutathione (GSH) content, catalase activities (CAT) and lipoperoxidation
      (as MDA) in liver were determined as stress-related biomarkers during the
      field exposure period. At the same time, the contents of polycyclic
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
      organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and heavy metals in the surface sediments
      of biomonitoring sites were also determined. The results indicate that the
      in situ exposed organisms were stressed. The marked increases of EROD,
      GSH, CAT and MDA in transplanted animals, suggested their potential
      application as biomarkers in pollution monitoring. Integrated biomarker
      response (IBR) was used to evaluate an integrated impact of toxicants from
      different polluted sites.

TI  - Metal chlorides loaded on activated carbon to capture elemental mercury.
PG  - 1814-9
AB  - Activated carbon (AC) was considered to be an effective sorbent to control
      mercury in combustion systems. However, its capture capacity was low and
      it required a high carbon-to-mercury mass ratio. AC loaded with catalyst
      showed a high elemental mercury (Hg0) capture capacity due to large
      surface area of AC and high oxidization ability of catalyst. In this
      study, several metal chlorides and metal oxides were used to promote the
      sorption capacity of AC. As a result, metal chlorides were better than
      metal oxides loaded on AC to remove gaseous mercury. X-ray diffractometer
      (XRD), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and specific surface area by
      Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET) analysis showed the main mechanisms:
      first, AC had an enormous surface area for loading enough MClx; second, Cl
      and MxOy were generated during pyrogenation of MClx; finally, there were
      lots of active elements such as Cl and MxOy which could react with
      elemental mercury and convert it to mercury oxide and mercury chloride.
      The HgO and HgCl2 might be released from AC's porous structure by thermo
      regeneration. A catalytic chemisorption mechanism predominates the
      sorption process of elemental mercury. As Co and Mn were valence variable
      metal elements, their catalytic effect on Hg0 oxidization may accelerate
      both oxidation and halogenation of Hg0. The sorbents loaded with metal
      chlorides possessed a synergistic function of catalytic effect of valence
      variable metal and chlorine oxidation.

TI  - Perchlorate removal using granular activated carbon supported iron
      compounds: synthesis, characterization and reactivity.
PG  - 1807-13
AB  - Synthesis and use of the iron compounds supported on granular activated
      carbon (ICs/GAC) have shown significant environmental implications for
      perchlorate (ClO4-) removal. ICs/GAC was synthesized via hydrolyzing FeSO4
      x 7H2O on GAC, reduced by NaBH4 solution in polyethylene glycol 6000 and
      ethanol solution, dried in vacuum condition and exposed to air.
      Synthesized ICs/GAC was characterized using transmission electron
      micrograph (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
      (XPS). ICs/GAC was determined to be containing a large amount of FeOHSO4,
      Fe2O3 and a small amount of zero-valent iron (ZVI) nanoparticles according
      to TEM and XPS measurements. Batch static kinetic tests showed that 97% of
      ClO4- was removed within 10 hr at 90 degrees C and 86% of ClO4- was
      removed within 12 hr at 25 degrees C, at ICs/GAC dosage of 20 g/L. The
      experimental results also showed that FeOHSO4 and Fe2O3 nanoparticles have
      the function of perchlorate adsorption and play important roles in ClO4-
      removal. The activation energy (E(a)) was determined to be 9.56 kJ/mol.

TI  - Efficient microwave-assisted photocatalytic degradation of endocrine
      disruptor dimethyl phthalate over composite catalyst ZrO(x)/ZnO.
PG  - 1800-6
AB  - A highly active ZrO(x)/ZnO catalyst for microwave-assisted photocatalytic
      (MW/PC) degradation of endocrine disruptor dimethyl phthalate (DMP) has
      been prepared via cetyltrimethylammonium assisted hydrothermal method. The
      ZrO(x)/ZnO was characterized by XPS, XRD, UV-Vis, BET and SEM techniques.
      The XPS result showed that Zr oxides with different valences (+2, +3, +4)
      co-existed in ZrO(x)/ZnO. By using the ZrO(x)/ZnO (0.1 g), the TOC removal
      efficiency of DMP (100 mL of 50 mg/L) was 88% after 30 min reaction, which
      was about 15% higher than P25 TiO2. It was found that the removal process
      of DMP by MW/PC followed pseudo first-order kinetics in all cases, and
      ZrO(x)/ZnO significantly accelerated the degradation of DMP. The
      degradation half-life time of DMP was shortened 45% compared with P25
      TiO2. A possible catalytic mechanism was proposed based on microwave
      response and interfacial charge transfer. ZrO(x)/ZnO could be reused for
      six times without obvious decrease in catalytic activity. The study offers
      new insights into designing highly efficient catalysts for MW/PC process
      and is applicable for MW/PC environmental remediation.

TI  - Heavy metals in rice and garden vegetables and their potential health
      risks to inhabitants in the vicinity of an industrial zone in Jiangsu,
      China.
PG  - 1792-9
AB  - Contamination of soil and agricultural products by heavy metals resulting
      from rapid industrial development has caused major concern. In this study,
      we investigated heavy metal (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Hg and Cd) concentrations in
      rice and garden vegetables, as well as in cultivated soils, in a
      rural-industrial developed region in southern Jiangsu, China, and
      estimated the potential health risks of metals to the inhabitants via
      consumption of locally produced rice and garden vegetables. A
      questionnaire-based survey on dietary consumption rates of foodstuffs
      showed that rice and vegetables accounted for 64% of total foodstuffs
      consumed, and over 60% of rice and vegetables were grown in the local
      region. Average concentrations of Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb were 0.75,
      2.64, 12.00, 0.014, 0.006 and 0.054 mg/kg dw (dry weight) in rice and were
      0.67, 1.18, 4.34, 0.011, 0.002 and 0.058 mg/kg fw (fresh weight) in garden
      vegetables, respectively. These values were all below the maximum
      allowable concentration in food in China except for Cr in vegetables.
      Leafy vegetables had higher metal concentrations than solanaceae
      vegetables. Average daily intake of Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb through the
      consumption of rice and garden vegetables were 5.66, 16.90, 74.21, 0.10,
      0.04 and 0.43 microg/(kg x day), respectively. Although Hazard Quotient
      values of individual metals were all lower than 1, when all six metal
      intakes via self-planted rice and garden vegetables were combined, the
      Hazard Index value was close to 1. Potential health risks from exposure to
      heavy metals in self-planted rice and garden vegetables need more
      attention.

TI  - Ecophysiological responses of winter wheat seedling to aerosol wet
      deposition of Xi'an area, China.
PG  - 1786-91
AB  - Aerosol leads to 30% reduction in solar radiation reaching the earth's
      surface, and a similar reduction in crops yield for both wheat and rice.
      To determine the effect of aerosol wet deposition on crops, aerosol
      samples were collected in September, 2006 at Xi'an urban suburb (34
      degrees 44'N, 109 degrees 49'E), and wheat seedlings were treated with
      aerosol of different concentrations in laboratory conditions. Changes in
      physiological and biochemical parameters of wheat seedlings were measured.
      In comparison with the control, the activities of superoxide dismudase
      (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and the concentration malondialdehyde (MDA) and
      oxidized glutathione (GSSG) of wheat seedlings increased progressively
      with increasing concentrations of added aerosol, while the opposite trend
      was seen for the activities of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the
      concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and nitric oxide (NO), and the ratio
      of GSH/GSSG. When the seedlings were treated with the aerosol of 1 and 2
      mg/L, the coleoptile elongation, shoot elongation and biomass accumulation
      were increased, the effect at treatment of 2 mg/L was most significant.
      However, aerosol treatments with rates of 3 and 4 mg/L resulted in a
      decrease in coleoptile elongation, shoot elongation and biomass
      accumulation in seedlings, and significant effect was for the treatment of
      4 mg/L. Hence, lower concentrations of aerosol wet deposition were in
      favor of crops growth, but its higher concentrations could result in
      deleterious effects for crops and decreased crops growth.

TI  - Photodegradation of new herbicide HW-02 in organic solvents.
PG  - 1774-8
AB  - HW-02 is a new organophosphates herbicide which is discovered and
      developed in China. The kinetics and mechanism of HW-02 photodegradation
      in the organic solvents were studied at 25 degrees C under the irradiation
      of ultraviolet light. The results showed that photochemical reaction of
      HW-02 in organic solvents such as n-hexane, methanol, dimethyl benzene and
      acetone under UV light could be well described by the first kinetic
      equation, and the photodegradation efficiency decreased with a order of
      n-hexane &gt; methanol &gt; xylene &gt; acetone. The photodegradation efficiency
      constant of HW-02 in n-hexane, methanol, xylene and acetone were 4.951 x
      10(-2), 3.253 x 10(-2), 2.377 x 10(-2) and 1.628 x 10-2 min(-1), and the
      corresponding half-lives were 13.99, 21.20, 29.15 and 42.56 min,
      respectively. By separation and identification of photoproducts using
      GC-MS, it could be concluded that HW-02 was photolyzed through ester
      cleavage, photo-dechlorination and photoisomerization of the molecule
      itself.

TI  - Nonylphenol in bivalves and sediments in the northeast coast of China.
PG  - 1735-40
AB  - To understand nonylphenol (NP) contamination in the northeast coastal
      environment in China, NP was determined in 19 sediment and 20 bivalve
      samples collected during November 2005. NP was identified in all sediment
      samples in the range of 8.8 to 1.0 x 10(3) ng/g dw (dry weight), with an
      average of 0.12 x 10(3) ng/g dw. Most of the bivalve samples (oysters and
      mussels) contained detectable amounts of NP that ranged from ND (not
      detected) to 7.6 x 10(3) ng/g dw, with an average value of 0.79 x 10(3)
      ng/g dw. These results indicated that NP is ubiquitous in sediments and
      bivalves from the northeast coast of China, and are even present in
      bivalves sold as seafood. Serious contamination with NP was recorded off
      the coast of Bohai Strait and in semi-enclosed coastal environment such as
      Jiaozhou Bay and Liaodong Bay. Possible environmental and human health
      implications were understood in this study.

TI  - Distribution of chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) in polluted rivers of the
      Juru River Basin, Penang, Malaysia.
PG  - 1718-27
AB  - The influence of physical and chemical parameters on the abundance and
      diversity of chironomids was studied in six rivers with moderate to highly
      polluted water in the Juru River Basin. The rivers: Ceruk Tok Kun (CTKR)
      as reference site, and polluted rivers of Pasir (PR), Juru (JR), Permatang
      Rawa (PRR), Ara (AR) and Kilang Ubi (KUR) were sampled over a period of
      five months (November 2007-March 2008). Nine chirnomid species: Chironimus
      kiiensis, C. javanus, Polypedilum trigonus, Microchironomus sp.,
      Dicrotendipes sp., Tanytarsus formosanus, Clinotanypus sp., Tanypus
      punctipennis and Fittkauimyia sp. were identified. Assessment of their
      relationships with several environmental parameters was performed using
      the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Tanytarsus formosanus was the
      most dominant in the relatively clean CTKR and moderately polluted JR with
      mean densities of 19.66 and 25.32 m(-2), respectively while C. kiiensis
      was abundant in more polluted rivers. Tanytarsus formosanus, Dicrotendipes
      sp. and Microchironomus sp. were grouped under moderate to high water
      temperature, total organic matter (TOM), total suspended solids (TSS),
      velocity, pH, phosphates and sulphates. However, Tanypus punctipennis,
      Fittkauimyia sp., and Clinotanypus sp. were associated with high contents
      of river sediment such as TOM, Zn and Mn and water ammonium-N and
      nitrate-N and they were associated with higher dissolved oxygen (DO)
      content in the water. Chironomus kiiensis, C. javanus and P. trigonus
      showed positive relationships with TOM, ammonium-N and nitrate-N as well
      as trace metals of Zn, Cu and Mn. These three species could be considered
      as tolerant species since they have the ability to survive in extreme
      environmental conditions with low DO and high concentrations of
      pollutants. Based on the water parameter scores in all rivers, the highest
      diversity of chironomid larvae was reported in CTKR. With higher
      concentrations of organic and/or inorganic pollutants as reported in PPR,
      KUR and AR, the chironomid larval diversity decreased, and the abundance
      of tolerant species, mainly Chironomus spp., increased.

      H2O2 dosage 17 mmol/L, and Fe2+ 1.7 mmol/L) the average total organic
      carbon (TOC) and color removal ratios were 39.3% and 69.5% after 35 min of
      reaction, respectively. Results from Zahn-Wallens Test also represented
      that Fenton process was effective to enhance the biodegradability of the
      test wastewater. As for the further purification of MBR process, TOC
      removal capacity was examined at different hydraulic retention times (HRT)
      of 10, 18 and 25 hr. Under the optimum HRT of 18 hr, the average TOC
      concentration and color of the final MBR effluent were 16.8 mg/L and 2
      dilution time, respectively. The sludge yield coefficient was 0.13 g
      MLSS/g TOC and TOC degradation rate was 0.078 kg TOC/(m3 x day). The final
      effluent of MBR can meet the reuse criteria of urban recycling water -
      water quality standard for miscellaneous water consumption GBT18920-2002.

TI  - Regulatory T cells and TH1/TH2 cytokines as immunodiagnosis keys in
      systemic autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - We assessed Helper T-cell involvement and possibilities to quantify the
      cell-based immune response in systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID) in 14
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 7 rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      patients. The goals of investigation were T-CD4+/T-CD8+ ratio, regulatory
      T cells (Treg) status and TH1/TH2 serum cytokine profiles (IFN-gamma and
      IL-2, respectively IL-4 and IL-6). SLE group proved significant decreased
      average Treg value as compared to RA group and controls and showed
      significant low Treg incidence (86% patients). The distribution of high
      T-CD4+/T-CD8+ ratio registered no significant distinction among LES and RA
      groups. SAID patients presented low serum IFN-gamma (86% RA, 60% SLE),
      high IL-2 (57% RA) and high IL-6 (53% LES), but no significant IL-4
      modification. We conclude that Treg percentage remains the only cellular
      criterion for SAID immune evaluation. In the same time, different
      secretion mechanisms seem to be involved in SAID, i.e. TH2 in SLE and TH1
      in RA.

TI  - Corelations between the ENT modifications and BMI in patients with sleep
      breathing disorders.
PG  - 784-7
AB  - AIM: To show if between the BMI index of weight and the oro and
      hypopharingeal modifications we can establish a link for the same value of
      the index of AHI hypoapnea. MATERIAL AND METHOD: At the patients with
      sleep breathing pathology of an obstructive type we conducted nasal, oro-
      and hypopharingeal endoscopic examinations, measurements and calculation
      of the weight index, followed by the polygraphic evaluation of the sleep,
      the establishment of the degree of sleep obstructive apnea; we used a form
      of ENT examination. The classification of patients according to the value
      of the apnea index of AHI hypoapnea in 3 groups: AHI &lt; 10, 10 &lt; AHI &lt; 50,
      and AHI &gt; 50. According to the value of the BMI weight index we analyze 3
      groups of patients: BMI &lt; 27, 27 &lt; BMI &lt; 40, BMI &gt; 40. RESULTS: For AHI &lt;
      10, habitual snoring we can notice that normal amygdales appear in an
      increased percent for BMI &lt; 27 or BMI &gt; 40 and AHI &lt; 10 the increased
      webbing is specific for 27 &lt; BMI &lt; 40. For AHI &gt; 50 the occurring
      oropharingeal modifications are: normal amygdales, long and broad uvula
      and webbing spanning between 5-10 mm. CONCLUSION: Oropharingeal
      modifications and the index of BMI weight are essential elements, taken
      individually in the preoperatory evaluation of patients with syndrome of
      obstructive sleep apnea.

TI  - Pressurized flight immediately after splenic infarction in two patients
      with the sickle cell trait.
PG  - 58-60
AB  - Splenic infarction in individuals harboring the sickle cell trait can
      occur in the setting of exposure to low oxygen tension at high altitudes.
      While this is a concern in unpressurized aircraft flight, it has not been
      well documented in pressurized flight. What has not been addressed is
      whether this relative safety of pressurized flight extends to the
      postinfarction period and whether or not pressurized flight in the
      immediate post-infarction period, especially air evacuation, would change
      the patient's outcome. We present two cases of splenic infarction suffered
      during climbing Mt. Fuji (12,388 ft, 3776 m) in patients harboring the
      sickle cell trait. Both patients were initially assessed and misdiagnosed
      by a local hospital. They then voluntarily took a 2-h, 30-min pressurized
      commercial flight [cruising altitude 40,000 ft (12,192 m), minimal cabin
      pressure: 0.73 atmospheric pressure] within 48 h of their initial
      presentation. Shortly after their arrival in their final destination they
      underwent a full workup, including a contrast enhanced CT scan, and were
      found to have the above-mentioned diagnosis. In both cases, supportive
      care was sufficient; both patients recovered without sequelae and did not
      deviate from what would be considered the standard, expected natural
      history of splenic infarction in patients with the sickle cell trait. It
      would seem from this anecdotal experience that pressurized commercial
      flights undertaken in the immediate post-splenic infarction period by
      individuals with the sickle cell trait may not change either the disease
      course or the patient's outcome and might be safe.

TI  - A no-decompression air dive and ultrasound lung comets.
PG  - 40-3
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased accumulation of extravascular lung water after
      repetitive deep trimix dives was recently reported. This effect was
      evident 40 min post-dive, but in subsequent studies most signs of this
      lung congestion were not evident 2-3 h post-dive, indicating no major
      negative effects on respiratory gas exchange following deep dives. Whether
      this response is unique for trimix dives or also occurs in more frequent
      air dives is presently unknown. METHODS: A single no-decompression field
      dive to 33 m with 20 min bottom time was performed by 12 male divers.
      Multiple ultrasound lung comets (ULC), bubble grade (BG), and
      single-breath lung diffusing capacity (DLCO) measurements were made before
      and up to 120 min after the dive. RESULTS: Median BG was rather high with
      maximal values observed at 40 min post-dive [median 4 (4-4)].
      Arterialization of bubbles from the venous side was observed only in one
      diver lasting up to 60 min post-dive. Despite high BG, no DCS symptoms
      were noted. DLCO and ULC were unchanged after the dive at any time point
      (DLCO(corr) was 33.6 +/- 1.9 ml x min(-1) mmHg(-1) pre-dive, 32.7 +/- 3.8
      ml x min(-1) x mmHg(-1) at 60 min post-dive, and 33.2 +/- 5.3 ml x min(-1)
      x mmHg(-1) at 120 min post-dive; ULC count was 4.1 +/- 1.9 pre-dive, 4.9
      +/- 3.3 at 20 min post-dive, and 3.3 +/- 1.9 at 60 min post-dive.
      DISCUSSION: These preliminary findings show no evidence of increased
      accumulation of extravascular lung water in male divers after a single
      no-decompression air dive at the limits of accepted Norwegian diving
      tables.

TI  - [Effects of electroacupuncture of different acupoint groups on sevoflurane
      anesthesia in patients undergoing resection of supratentorial tumors].
PG  - 368-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of different
      acupoint groups on the sevoflurane anesthetic requirement for resection of
      supratentorial tumors and the speed of post-operation recovery. METHODS: A
      total of 120 cases of supratentorial tumor resection patients were
      randomly and equally allocated into general anesthesia (GA) group,
      EA-proximal acupoints group (EA-PA group) and EA-distant acupoints group
      (EA-DA group). The supratentorial tumor patients were anesthetized with
      sevoflurane for surgery. Proximal acupoints used were Fengchi (GB 20),
      Tianzhu (BL 10), Cuanzhu (BL 2) and Yuyao (EX-HN 4) that the former 2
      acupoints and the latter 2 acupoints were for penetrative needling; and
      distant acupoints used were Hegu (LI 4), Waiguan (TE 5), Jinmen (BL 63),
      Taichong (LR 3), Zusanli (ST 36) and Qiuxu (GB 40) on the craniotomy side,
      and stimulated with EA (2 Hz/100 Hz, a tolerable electric stimulating
      strength), beginning from the anesthesia induction till the end of
      surgical operation. All patients were anesthetized by inhalation of
      propofol (2 mg/kg), sufentanil (0.3 microg/kg) and vecuronium bromide (0.1
      mg/kg) and maintained with sevoflurane. The end-tidal sevoflurane
      concentration, minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), bispectral index
      (BIS), and the speed of recovery were recorded. RESULTS: In comparison
      with the GA group, the end-tidal concentrations during anesthesia
      maintenance at the time-points of post skull drilling, dura incising,
      intracranial operation in EA-PA group, the time-points of post skull
      drilling, skull opening, dura incising, and intracranial operation in
      EA-DA group, and the MAC of sevoflurane at the time-points of skull
      drilling in EA-DA group, and skull opening, dura incising, intracranial
      operation and dura suturing in both EA-PA and EA-DA groups were
      significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). Compared to the GA group, the
      BIS values of EA-DA group at the time-points of skull drilling and
      opening, and dura incising were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05), while
      during the recovery stage of anesthesia, in comparison with the GA group,
      the autonomous respiration recovery time, tracheo-tube removing time,
      eye-opening time, voluntary motion recovery time, orientation force
      recovery time, and operating room-departure time of both EA-PA and EA-DA
      groups were significantly shorter (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). No significant
      differences were found between the EA-PA and EA-DA groups in the
      aforementioned indexes (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: EA of both proximal and
      distant acupoints can reduce the expired concentration and MAC of
      sevoflurane during anesthesia maintenance, and accelerate the recovery
      after cease of anesthesia in supratentorial tumor resection patients.

TI  - Social energy exchange theory for postpartum depression.
PG  - 15-21
AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD), a significant health problem affecting about
      19.4% of postpartum women worldwide, may result in long-term cognitive and
      behavior problems in children, spousal depression, widespread family
      dysfunction, and chronic and increasingly severe maternal depression.
      Although current theoretical frameworks provide a rich context for
      studying PPD,none provides a framework that specifically addresses the
      dynamic relationship of the inner personal experience with the social and
      cultural context of PPD. The authors propose the social energy exchange
      theory for postpartum depression to understand how PPD impedes this
      dynamic relationship and suggest it as a theoretical framework for the
      study of interventions that would target intra- and interpersonal
      disturbance within the social and cultural context.

PG  - 263-6
LID - 10.1002/ar.21298 [doi]
AB  - Using high resolution X-ray computed tomography data we examined the
      relationship between cochlear labyrinth volume and body mass in extant,
      non-primate euarchontoglirans, and in two fossils, to allow for comparison
      with the results of Kirk and Gosselin-Ildari (2009). Modern primates have
      significantly higher cochlear labyrinth volumes relative to body mass than
      other euarchontoglirans, which may be related to a downward shift in the
      highest and lowest audible frequencies over the course of primate
      evolution, and to the relative increase in brain size observed in
      Euprimates.

AB  - The frequency, structure, mode of formation and significance of sealed
      osteons remain unsettled. Sealed osteons have been reported as an unusual
      finding in the cortical bone of experimental animals: we extended the
      observation to human cortical bone studied with SEM. Tibial bone specimens
      from three patients who sustained a traumatic below-the-knee amputation
      were used in the study. The observed total mean density of osteons was
      19.25/mm(2) and the percentage of sealed and partially sealed osteons was
      4.2% and 1.7% respectively. The material sealing the central canal showed
      an X-ray microanalysis spectrum with the same Ca/P ratio as the peripheral
      lamellae and a lower carbon signal. The morphology suggested a
      reactivation of bone apposition triggered by exclusion of the occluded
      canal from blood flow rather than a physiological evolution of the closing
      process of secondary osteons. This presupposes collapse and degeneration
      of the central vessel before the osteoblasts resting on the inner surface
      of the canal could start to lay down new bone matrix. This explanation is
      consistent with a dynamic model of intracortical blood flow.

TI  - Volumetric reconstruction of the mouse meibomian gland using
      high-resolution nonlinear optical imaging.
PG  - 185-92
LID - 10.1002/ar.21305 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies suggest that mouse meibomian glands (MG) undergo
      age-related atrophy that mimics changes seen in age-related human MG
      dysfunction (MGD). To better understand the structural/functional changes
      that occur during aging, this study developed an imaging approach to
      generate quantifiable volumetric reconstructions of the mouse MG and
      measure total gland, cell, and lipid volume. Mouse eyelids were fixed in
      4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in LR White resin and serially sectioned.
      Sections were then scanned using a 20x objective and a series of tiled
      images (1.35 x 1.35 x 0.5 mm) with a pixel size of 0.44 microm lateral and
      2 microm axial were collected using a Zeiss 510 Meta LSM and a femtosecond
      laser to simultaneously detect second harmonic generated (SHG) and
      two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) signals from the tissue sections.
      The SHG signal from collagen was used to outline and generate an MG mask
      to create surface renderings of the total gland and extract relevant MG
      TPEF signals that were later separated into the cellular and lipid
      compartments. Using this technique, three-dimensional reconstructions of
      the mouse MG were obtained and the total, cell, and lipid volume of the MG
      measured. Volumetric reconstructions of mouse MG showed loss of acini in
      old mice that were not detected by routine histology. Furthermore, older
      mouse MG had reduced total gland volume that is primarily associated with
      loss of the lipid volume. These findings suggest that mice MG undergo
      &quot;dropout&quot; of acini, similar to that which occurs in human age-related MGD.

PG  - 163-8
LID - 10.1002/psc.1299 [doi]
AB  - Peptides identified by the PD method against a film surface composed of
      azobenzene-containing synthetic polymers were characterized by QCM
      measurements. Among the four peptides analyzed, the c16 peptide with the
      sequence Trp-His-Thr-Leu-Pro-Asn-Ala showed the highest binding affinity
      to the films rich in cis-azobenzene groups. SPR served to determine the
      association/dissociation constants of the c16 peptide against the trans-
      and cis-azobenzene groups. The binding constants were estimated to be 1.3
      x 10(5) and 1.4 x 10(6) /M, respectively, indicating a high specificity of
      the c16 peptide for cis-azobenzene conformer. Then mutants of the c16
      peptide were synthesized and characterized to gain information on the
      structural requirements for the cis-form specificity. An Ala-scan clearly
      revealed that all the amino acid residues of the c16 peptide were
      essential for the specificity. More importantly, the results with peptides
      of inverted sequence and containing Gly insertions confirmed that the
      specificity is strictly derived from the primary sequence of the c16
      peptide.

      a gold surface: antenna and junction effects.
PG  - 124-31
LID - 10.1002/psc.1329 [doi]
AB  - The photocurrent generation properties of mono- and bi-component
      peptide-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) immobilized on a gold
      surface were studied by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. The
      peptides investigated comprised almost exclusively C-tetrasubstituted
      -amino acids. These non-coded residues, because of their unique
      conformational properties, forced the peptide backbone to attain a helical
      conformation, as confirmed by X-ray crystal structure and CD
      determinations in solution. The peptide helical structure promoted the
      formation of a stable SAM on the gold surface, characterized by an
      electric macrodipole directed from the C(delta-) to the N(delta+)
      terminus, that remarkably affected the electron transfer (ET) process
      through the peptide chain. The peptides investigated were derivatized with
      chromophores strongly absorbing in the UV region to enhance the efficiency
      of the photocurrent generation (antenna effect). The influence of the
      nature of the peptide-gold interface on the ET process (junction effect)
      was analyzed by comparing the photocurrent generation process in peptide
      SAMs immobilized on a gold surface through AuS linkages with that in a
      bi-component SAM embedding a photoactive peptide into the linked palisade
      formed by disulfide-functionalized peptides.

TI  - Th1/Th2 Cytokine profiles in G+/G- bacteremia in pediatric
      hematology/oncology patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of infection and appropriate choice of
      antibiotics are essential not only to improve the prognosis of the
      patients but also to prevent from the abuse of the antibiotics in
      hematology/oncology children at the time of neutropenia after intensive
      chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: We evaluated the quantification of Th1/Th2
      cytokines with flow cytometry bead assay (CBA) in 145 hospitalized febrile
      hematology/oncology children with positive blood culture to seek for a
      rapid diagnostic method to determine the type of infection. RESULTS: IL-4,
      IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma levels from both G- and G+
      bacteremia groups were significantly higher than those of controls (P &lt;
      0.001). The median levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha of Group G- were
      525.4, 96.0, and 6.9 pg/ml, respectively, significantly higher than those
      of Group G+ (150.0, 22.6, and 4.5 pg/ml, respectively, P &lt; 0.001).
      According to the different degrees of increased IL-6 and IL-10 levels, we
      named the G- bacterial infection related cytokine profile G- BIRCP and the
      G+ BIRCP. The specificity and sensitivity of BIRCP prediction for G- and
      G+ bacteria cultures were 60.2% and 75.4%, 66.8% and 70.1%, respectively.
      Similar therapeutic efficacy was achieved between BIRCP-based and
      broad-spectrum antibiotics groups (86.1% vs. 89.3%, P &gt; 0.05), which was
      significantly increased as compared with that (65.5%, P &lt; 0.05) of
      empirical group. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed the promising use of
      the IL-6/IL-10/TNF-alpha determination with CBA technology for the early
      and rapid diagnosis, evaluation of G+/G- bacteremia in pediatric
      hematology/oncology patients. Pediatr Blood Cancer (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss,

TI  - Giardia intestinalis escapes oxidative stress by colonizing the small
      intestine: A molecular hypothesis.
AB  - Giardia intestinalis is the microaerophilic protozoon causing giardiasis,
      a common infectious intestinal disease. Giardia possesses an
      O(2)-scavenging activity likely essential for survival in the host. We
      report that Giardia trophozoites express the O(2)-detoxifying flavodiiron
      protein (FDP), detected by immunoblotting, and are able to reduce O(2) to
      H(2)O rapidly ( approximately 3 muM O(2) x min x 10(6) cells at 37 
      degrees C) and with high affinity (C(50) = 3.4 +/- 0.7 muM O(2)).
      Following a short-term (minutes) exposure to H(2)O(2) &gt;/= 100 muM, the
      O(2) consumption by the parasites is irreversibly impaired, and the FDP
      undergoes a degradation, prevented by the proteasome-inhibitor MG132.
      Instead, H(2)O(2) does not cause degradation or inactivation of the
      isolated FDP. On the basis of the elevated susceptibility of Giardia to
      oxidative stress, we hypothesize that the parasite preferentially
      colonizes the small intestine since, compared with colon, it is
      characterized by a greater capacity for redox buffering and a lower
      propensity to oxidative stress. (c) 2011 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 2011.

TI  - Submucosal nerve hypertrophy in congenital laryngomalacia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS:: To determine the neuropathologic findings in
      tissue obtained from children with laryngomalacia at a tertiary-care
      pediatric hospital. STUDY DESIGN:: Retrospective review of consecutive
      cohort compared with a control group. METHODS:: We reviewed
      supra-arytenoid pathology specimens from 43 children with severe
      laryngomalacia and 13 age-matched pediatric autopsy controls.
      Histopathologic comparison was made of nerve hypertrophy (including nerve
      perimeter and surface area) among experimental and control pathologic
      specimens. RESULTS:: There exists a statistically significant increase in
      nerve perimeter (P = .001) and nerve surface area (P = .02) in
      supra-arytenoid specimens in patients with severe laryngomalacia compared
      with age-matched autopsy supra-arytenoid tissue. CONCLUSIONS:: The
      pathologic finding of nerve hypertrophy in children with laryngomalacia
      provides new evidence to support neurologic dysfunction as the etiologic
      theory of laryngomalacia.

      and periorbital skull base surgery over a 40-month period were reviewed.
      Lesion location, surgical approach, pathology, and postoperative
      complications are summarized. The details of the technique as well as
      limitations and advantages of this approach are summarized. RESULTS::
      Eighteen patients who underwent endoscopic orbital apex surgery were
      identified. Eleven (61%) of the patients were men, and the average age was
      51 years. The majority of lesions, 12 (67%), were located in the medial
      orbit and/or optic canal, two (11%) in the cavernous sinus and/or superior
      orbital fissure, and four (22%) in the inferior orbit and/or
      pterygopalatine fossa. The etiologies were diverse, including benign
      (44%), malignant (28%), infectious (11%), and inflammatory (17%). The
      majority of cases, 67%, were approached by the transnasal endoscopic
      technique followed by 28% with a combined transnasal and transcaruncular
      approach, and 6% by the sublabial approach. Complications occurred in 22%
      of cases. CONCLUSIONS:: Conventional orbitotomy techniques and craniotomy
      are frequently used to access lesions in the orbital apex. The more
      recently described endoscopic technique with intraoperative image guidance
      can provide access to a subset orbital apical and periorbital skull base
      lesions. In carefully selected cases, this technique provides excellent
      visualization and access to the orbital apex and avoids larger
      craniofacial surgeries.

TI  - A randomized comparison of manual versus mechanical thrombus removal in
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention in the treatment of ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction (TREAT-MI).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and
      long-term clinical outcome of manual thrombus aspiration with the Export
      catheter (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) versus mechanical thrombus
      cutting/aspiration with the X-sizer system (eV3, White Bear Lake, MN, USA)
      in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). BACKGROUND: In PPCI
      for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), markers of
      myocardial reperfusion are improved with adjunctive thrombectomy. Previous
      studies of different devices showed a variability in performance,
      suitability, and short-term clinical outcome. In current literature, no
      direct comparison is available. METHODS: We prospectively randomized 201
      patients admitted for PPCI for STEMI to either the Export catheter or the
      X-sizer prior to stent deployment. Technical success in advancing to and
      across the lesion, improvement of flow, reduction of thrombus and the
      effect on ST-segment resolution were examined. The primary endpoint of the
      follow-up study was the combined endpoint of cardiac death, recurrent
      myocardial infarction (MI), or target-vessel revascularization (TVR) at 3
      years. RESULTS: Although the Export catheter was more successfully
      deployed, other procedural parameters were similar with a trend toward
      better ST-segment resolution (56.6% vs 44%; P = 0.06) as compared to the
      X-sizer system. The occurrence of the primary clinical endpoint at 3 years
      was 22.2% and 18.6%, respectively (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.65-2.22; P=0.35).
      CONCLUSION: Despite shorter procedural times, better lesion crossing, and
      fewer complications, both surrogate endpoints as well as 3-year clinical
      follow-up were similar with the use of the Export catheter as compared to
      the X-sizer system. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Inherited balanced translocation t(9;17)(q33.2;q25.3) concomitant with a
      16p13.1 duplication in a patient with schizophrenia.
AB  - We report two rare genetic aberrations in a schizophrenia patient that may
      act together to confer disease susceptibility. A previously unreported
      balanced t(9;17)(q33.2;q25.3) translocation was observed in two
      schizophrenia-affected members of a small family with diverse psychiatric
      disorders. The proband also carried a 1.5 Mbp microduplication at 16p13.1
      that could not be investigated in other family members. The duplication
      has been reported to predispose to schizophrenia, autism and mental
      retardation, with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. The
      t(9;17) (q33.2;q25.3) translocation breakpoint occurs within the open
      reading frames of KIAA1618 on 17q25.3, and TTLL11 (tyrosine tubulin ligase
      like 11) on 9q33.2, causing no change in the expression level of KIAA1618
      but leading to loss of expression of one TTLL11 allele. TTLL11 belongs to
      a family of enzymes catalyzing polyglutamylation, an unusual
      neuron-specific post-translational modification of microtubule proteins,
      which modulates microtubule development and dynamics. The 16p13.1
      duplication resulted in increased expression of NDE1, encoding a DISC1
      protein partner mediating DISC1 functions in microtubule dynamics. We
      hypothesize that concomitant TTLL11-NDE1 deregulation may increase
      mutation load, among others, also on the DISC1 pathway, which could
      contribute to disease pathogenesis through multiple effects on neuronal
      development, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmission. Our data
      illustrate the difficulties in interpreting the contribution of multiple
      potentially pathogenic changes likely to emerge in future next-generation
      sequencing studies, where access to extended families will be increasingly
      important. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Evaluation of risk loci for schizophrenia derived from genome-wide
      association studies in a German population.
AB  - In the genome-wide association study (GWAS) on schizophrenia [O'Donovan et
      al. (2008); Nat Genet 40:1053-1055] a UK-sample of 479 cases with DSM-IV
      schizophrenia was genotyped in comparison to control subjects with follow
      up of 12 putative loci in international replication sets of approximately
      15,000 cases and controls. In these cohorts and a combined bipolar and
      schizophrenia UK-sample, six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      supported association, with the strongest evidence for SNP-marker
      rs1344706 at the zinc finger ZNF804A locus on chromosome 2q32.1 (P = 1.61
      x 10(-7)). We attempted replication of these findings in a German
      population of 2,154 individuals (632 with affective disorders, 937 with
      schizophrenia, and 585 controls), but found none of the GWAS risk alleles
      significantly associated with psychosis. Particularly rs1344706, initially
      surpassing the genome-wide significance level in an extended phenotype of
      schizophrenia and affective disorder, produced consistently negative
      results. At the ZNF804A locus estimated Odds ratios reached 1.08
      (0.93-1.26 95% CI) for the schizophrenia sample and 1.04 (0.90-1.20 95%
      CI) for the combined set of cases with schizophrenia and affective
      disorder. The main limitation of our study may be the reduced power of the
      sample size, but our data may be useful for future meta-analysis of GWA
      data sets. Although GWAS have proven extraordinary successful in
      identifying susceptibility genes for complex genetic disorders, the
      hypothesis of common genetic variants in the complex group of the
      schizophrenic psychoses with small effect size but relatively high
      frequency is still put to further scrutiny. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Genetic association and sequencing of the insulin-like growth factor 1
      gene in bipolar affective disorder.
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) has been shown to have an important
      role in brain development and function. Studies of IGF1 administration in
      rodents have shown that it has an anxiolytic and antidepressant effect. A
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the first University College
      London (UCL) cohort of 506 bipolar affective disorder subjects and 510
      controls was carried out. The exons and flanking regions of IGF1 were
      resequenced, any new polymorphisms found were genotyped in an enlarged UCL
      sample of 937 cases and 941 controls. GWAS data gave good evidence of
      allelic and haplotypic association between multiple IGF1 SNP's and bipolar
      disorder (BD). New polymorphisms were found by resequencing IGF1 region.
      Data from GWAS and the new markers showed that twelve out of 43 SNPs
      showed association with BD with the four most significant SNPs having
      values of 3.7 x 10(-5), 8.4 x 10(-4), 2.6 x 10(-4), and 2.5 x 10(-4). A 5'
      promoter microsatellite polymorphism previously correlated with plasma
      lipoprotein concentration was also associated with BD (P = 0.013).
      Haplotypic association confirmed association with BD with significance
      values similar to the single marker SNP values. The marker rs12426318 has
      also been found to be associated with BD in a second sample. A test of
      gene wide significance with permutation testing for all markers genotyped
      at IGF1 was also significant. These data implicate IGF1 as a candidate
      gene to cause genetic susceptibility to BD. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

      insensitivity].
PG  - 271-3
AB  - The Morris syndrome is a X-linked recessive condition due to a complete or
      partial insensitivity to androgens, resulting in a failure of normal
      masculinization of the external genitalia in chromosomally male
      individuals. This failure of virilization can be either complete or
      partial depending on the amount of residual androgen receptor function.
      The phenotype of individuals with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome
      may range from mildly virilized female external genitalia to mildly
      undervirilized male external genitalia. We describe a case of Partial
      Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome in a 21-year-old patient with a 46, XY
      karyotype, bilateral inguinal masses, clitoral enlargement and partial
      posterior labial fusion. Surgical care consisted of bilateral orchiectomy
      and plastic surgery of external genitalia. The patient underwent estrogen
      replacement therapy.

AB  - Low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is an uncommon soft tissue tumor. We present
      the case of a 83-year-old female who developed large mass in the right
      kidney. A nephrectomy was performed. The tumor measured 18,5x17,5x11,5 cm
      and on pathology evaluation was diagnosed as low grade fibromyxoid
      sarcoma. Currently, the patient is doing well without evidence of local
      recurrence and distant metastasis. Low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma of the
      Kidney is a very rare tumor. The metastasizing potential is high.
      Sometimes long interval between tumor presentation and metastasis is
      observed. The treatment of choice is surgery. The role of radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy is uncertain.

TI  - The -11377C &gt; G adiponectin gene polymorphism alters the adiponectin
      concentration and the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Thais.
PG  - 216-24
AB  - The aims of this study were first to detect the levels of adiponectin,
      insulin, albumin, glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lipids,
      homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and
      anthropometric variables in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as
      healthy control groups, and to determine whether two adiponectin gene
      polymorphisms, at the position -11377C &gt; G as well as +45T &gt; G, are
      associated with serum levels of adiponectin and other variables; then to
      search for the association between these two single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) of the adiponectin gene and T2DM. We investigated 93
      T2DM patients and 90 healthy volunteers. Compared with the healthy control
      group, the T2DM group had significantly lower adiponectin levels. Waist
      circumference, total cholesterol, ALT, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR
      scores were significantly higher in the T2DM group than in the control
      group. The polymorphism of the adiponectin gene at position -11377C &gt; G
      among type 2 diabetes subjects showed that the adiponectin concentration
      was significantly lower in CG/GG genotypes (6.2 mug/mL) than the CC
      genotype (7.8 mug/mL), whereas SNP +45T &gt; G was not associated with
      adiponectin levels. Adiponectin gene polymorphisms at position -11377C &gt; G
      and +45T &gt; G were significantly more frequent in type 2 diabetes patients
      than in the control group (p = 0.022; p = 0.045, respectively). However,
      multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the strong impact on
      T2DM was found for -11377C &gt; G gene polymorphism (p = 0.023) and waist
      circumference (p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, the single nucleotide polymorphism
      of -11377C &gt; G in adiponectin promoter region has impact on the lower
      adiponectin concentrations, and may influence susceptibility to T2DM in
      Thais.

TI  - Ageing, Neuronal Connectivity and Brain Disorders: An Unsolved Ripple
      Effect.
AB  - Cognitive decline associated with ageing and age-related disorders emerges
      as one of the greatest health challenges in the next decades. To date, the
      molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of neuronal physiological
      changes in the central nervous system remain unclear. Functional MRI and
      PET studies have indicated the decline in working memory performance in
      older adults. Similarly, age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's
      disease, are associated with changes in the prefontral cortex and related
      neural circuitry, which underlines the decline of integrative function
      between different brain regions. This is mainly attributed to the loss of
      synaptic connectivity, which is a feature commonly observed in
      neurodegenerative disorders. In humans, the morphological and functional
      changes in neurons, such as reduction of spine numbers and synaptic
      dysfunction, precede the first signs of cognitive decline and likely
      contribute to pathology progression. Thus, a new scenario emerges in which
      apparently unrelated diseases present common features, such as the
      remodelling of neuronal circuitries promoted by ageing. For many years,
      ageing was considered a process of slow deterioration triggered by
      accidental environmental factors. Conversely, it is now evident that
      ageing is a biological process tightly controlled by evolutionary highly
      conserved signalling pathways. Importantly, genetic mutations that enhance
      longevity significantly delay the loss of synaptic connectivity and,
      therefore, the onset of age-related brain disorders. Accordingly, tweaking
      ageing might be an attractive approach to prevent cognitive decline caused
      by age-related synaptic dysfunction.

TI  - Interactions of persistent sodium and calcium-activated nonspecific
      cationic currents yield dynamically distinct bursting regimes in a model
      of respiratory neurons.
AB  - The preBotzinger complex (preBotC) is a heterogeneous neuronal network
      within the mammalian brainstem that has been experimentally found to
      generate robust, synchronous bursts that drive the inspiratory phase of
      the respiratory rhythm. The persistent sodium (NaP) current is observed in
      every preBotC neuron, and significant modeling effort has characterized
      its contribution to square-wave bursting in the preBotC. Recent
      experimental work demonstrated that neurons within the preBotC are endowed
      with a calcium-activated nonspecific cationic (CAN) current that is
      activated by a signaling cascade initiated by glutamate. In a preBotC
      model, the CAN current was shown to promote robust bursts that experience
      depolarization block (DB bursts). We consider a self-coupled model neuron,
      which we represent as a single compartment based on our experimental
      finding of electrotonic compactness, under variation of g (NaP), the
      conductance of the NaP current, and g (CAN), the conductance of the CAN
      current. Varying these two conductances yields a spectrum of activity
      patterns, including quiescence, tonic activity, square-wave bursting, DB
      bursting, and a novel mixture of square-wave and DB bursts, which match
      well with activity that we observe in experimental preparations. We
      elucidate the mechanisms underlying these dynamics, as well as the
      transitions between these regimes and the occurrence of bistability, by
      applying the mathematical tools of bifurcation analysis and slow-fast
      decomposition. Based on the prevalence of NaP and CAN currents, we expect
      that the generalizable framework for modeling their interactions that we
      present may be relevant to the rhythmicity of other brain areas beyond the
      preBotC as well.

TI  - Pulsed laser deposition of hydroxyapatite on titanium substrate with
      titania interlayer.
AB  - Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been used to deposit hydroxyapatite (HA)
      ceramic over titanium substrate with an interlayer of titania. PLD has
      been identified as a potential candidate for bioceramic coatings over
      metallic substrates to be used as orthopedic and dental implants because
      of better process control and preservation of phase identity of the
      coating component. However, direct deposition of hydroxyapatite on
      titanium at elevated temperature results in the formation of natural oxide
      layer along with some perovskites like calcium titanate at the interface.
      This leads to easy debonding of ceramic layer from the metal and thereby
      affecting the adhesion strength. In the present study, adherent and stable
      HA coating over Ti6Al4V was achieved with the help of an interlayer of
      titania. The interlayer was made to a submicron level and HA was deposited
      consecutively to a thickness of around one micron by exposing to laser
      ablation at a substrate temperature of 400 degrees C. The deposited phase
      was identified to be phase pure HA by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
      microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and inductively coupled
      plasma spectrometry. The mechanical behavior of coating evaluated by
      scratch test indicates that the adhesion strength of HA coating was
      improved with the presence of titania interlayer.

TI  - Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus causes a stronger inflammatory response than
      seasonal H1N1 influenza virus in ferrets.
AB  - A 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, which had its origin in swine,
      caused severe illness and mortality in humans. Inflammatory responses may
      be responsible for pathogenesis caused by infection with influenza
      viruses. To better understand the pathogenic mechanism, clinical signs and
      inflammatory responses in ferrets infected with the pandemic H1N1 were
      compared with those caused by seasonal H1N1 influenza virus. Ferrets
      infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus displayed higher body
      temperatures, greater reduction in body weight, and higher viral titers in
      the tracheae and lungs. Levels of inflammatory cytokines, including
      interleukin-6, interferon-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were
      higher in the lungs of ferrets infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1. The
      data support the idea that increased pathogenesis caused by the 2009
      pandemic H1N1 influenza virus may have been partially mediated by a higher
      induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of affected humans or
      animals.

TI  - Downregulation of the hedgehog receptor PTCH1 in colorectal serrated
      adenocarcinomas is not caused by PTCH1 mutations.
PG  - 213-9
AB  - Colorectal serrated adenocarcinoma forms about 15-20% of colorectal
      carcinomas. We have previously shown that downregulation of PTCH1 is
      distinctive for this type of colorectal cancer. In several other tumor
      types, somatic inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been shown to lead to
      aberrant Hedgehog signaling, but in colorectal cancer the role of PTCH1
      mutations has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we have analyzed the
      mutation status of PTCH1 in a series of 33 colorectal serrated
      adenocarcinomas by sequencing all 23 coding exons. We detected 11
      previously known SNPs and eight new alterations. The latter included five
      synonymous changes and two previously unknown missense variations, somatic
      M319V, and germline V1231A. V1231A was also present in population controls
      and likely represents polymorphism. The somatic M319V variant does not
      appear to be an attractive candidate for a disease-associated mutation
      because in silico analyses did not support the pathogenic nature of the
      change. A somatic, intronic 1-bp deletion was detected in a short poly(T)
      stretch in two microsatellite unstable tumors. None of the three changes
      had predicted effect on splicing when analyzed in silico. Our results did
      not reveal any clearly deleterious inactivating PTCH1 mutations in our
      collection of colorectal serrated adenocarcinomas. This suggests that
      other mechanisms are involved in the observed downregulation of the PTCH1
      gene. These might include, e.g., constantly active MAPK signaling by KRAS
      or BRAF mutations or silencing of PTCH1 by hypermethylation, and further
      studies are needed to reveal these mechanisms.

TI  - Sudden death of an immunocompetent young adult caused by novel (swine
      origin) influenza A/H1N1-associated myocarditis.
AB  - The main cause of death from novel (swine origin) influenza A/H1N1
      infection is acute respiratory distress syndrome. Most fatal cases are
      immunocompromised patients or patients with a severe underlying disease.
      Here, we report a fatal case of acute interstitial myocarditis associated
      with novel influenza A/H1N1 infection in an immunocompetent young woman. A
      previously healthy 18-year-old woman experienced malaise, diarrhea, and
      fever for several days prior to a sudden collapse at home. Autopsy
      revealed a predominantly lymphocytic myocarditis in the absence of a
      significant respiratory tract infection. Infection with novel (swine
      origin) influenza A/H1N1 was confirmed by PCR analysis of blood as well as
      myocardial tissue. Influenza-caused diarrhea with consecutive hypokalemia
      potentially contributed to the fatal outcome of the myocarditis,
      characterized by ventricular fibrillation. In conclusion, sudden death by
      myocarditis may be a rare complication of novel influenza A/H1N1 infection
      in otherwise healthy individuals, even in the absence of significant
      respiratory tract infection.

TI  - Molecular characterization of thyroid hormone-inhibited atrial L-type
      calcium channel expression: implication for atrial fibrillation in
      hyperthyroidism.
PG  - 163-74
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication in hyperthyroidism.
      Earlier studies demonstrate that thyroid hormone decreases L-type calcium
      channel (LCC) current expression with resultant shortening of action
      potential duration (APD), providing a substrate for AF. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the potential mechanism underlying the regulatory
      effect of thyroid hormone on LCC. In a hyperthyroid rat model, thyroid
      hormone (triiodothyronine [T3]) administration down-regulated atrial LCC
      expression. In vitro, treatment of murine atrial myocytes (HL-1) with T3
      decreased the expression of LCC and its current, resulting in abbreviation
      of APD. Furthermore, T3 inhibited the activation of cyclic AMP response
      element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), including phosphorylation at Ser133
      and its nuclear translocation. Transient transfection studies in HL-1
      cells indicated that T3 reduced LCC promoter activity. Deletion and
      mutation analysis of the LCC promoter region along with chromatin
      immunoprecipitation using anti-CREB antibody showed that CRE was essential
      for T3-mediated LCC gene expression. Transfection of dominant-negative
      CREB (mutated Ser133) and mutant thyroid hormone receptor (TR, mutated
      Cys51) abolished the T3-dependent effects, suggesting an association
      between both transcriptional factors. Co-immunoprecipitation documented an
      increased binding of TR with CREB after T3 treatment. The transcriptional
      cross-talk 3 between TR and CREB bound to CRE mediates T3-inhibited CREB
      activity and LCC expression. Thyroid hormone-induced TR binding of CREB
      inhibits CREB activity and LCC current expression, which may contribute to
      AF. These findings provide an important mechanistic insight into
      hyperthyroidism-induced AF.

TI  - The Effect of SYT-SSX and Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) on
      Cell Proliferation in Synovial Sarcoma.
AB  - The character of Synovial sarcoma is the chromosomal translocation t(X;
      18)(p11.2;q11.2), which results in the fusion of the SYT gene with a SSX
      gene. There is little study that could fully elucidate the mechanism of
      pathogenesis of this fusion transcript. This study is designed to gain
      more insight into the function of this fusion gene. We evaluated the whole
      genome expression in SYO-1 cells inhibited as a result of specific small
      interfering RNA for SYT-SSX. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were
      analyzed by flow cytometer and MTT. The proteins correlated with
      proliferation were also detected using western blot. TUNEL and
      Immunohistochemical stain assessment were also carried out on TMA of SS
      tissues. The mRNA level reduced over 90% caused by SYT-SSX specific siRNA.
      Five pathways were employed, that ERK1/2 pathway was differential
      significantly (p = 0.043218). Meanwhile, down-regulation of SYT-SSX fusion
      gene expression would inhibit the proliferation of SS cell and the
      survival rate decreased (34.1%), while apoptotic rate increased (10.92%).
      After transfected with SYT-SSX-specific siRNA it caused a block in G1/G0
      phase (31.99%) of SYO-1 cells compared with control cells. The protein
      level of ERK1/2, p-ERK, and cyclin D1 altered in same trend with
      expression of SYT-SSX. In TMA stain assessment, SYT-SSX positive group
      with high ki-67 LI expressed more cyclin D1and CDK4 than the SYT-SSX
      negative group. High ki-67 LI was detected in cases with p-ERK expression.
      Meanwhile, cyclin D1 and CDK4 were shown to be more expressed in tumor
      cells with p-ERK expression. Our results suggest that the fusion gene
      SYT-SSX should be considered to play important role on SS cell growth via
      ERK pathway. This study may be valuable for understanding the pathogenic
      role and molecular mechanism of the fusion gene SYT-SSX in synovial
      sarcoma through the proposed genome-wide approach. Furthermore, the
      research would open up the possibility of using SYT-SSX and ERK as a
      therapeutic target.

TI  - Uric acid in the early risk stratification of ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction.
AB  - Controversy still exists about uric acid as a potential prognosticrisk
      factor for outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction. We
      prospectively assessed, in 856 patients with ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction (STMI) consecutively admitted to our Intensive Cardiac Care
      Unit after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) whether uric
      acid (UA) levels are associated with in-hospital mortality and
      complications. Killip classes III--IV were more frequent in the 3 degrees 
      UA tertile that was associated with the highest values of peak Tn I (p =
      0.005), NT-proBNP (p &lt; 0.001), and fibrinogen (p = 0.036). Uric acid was
      associated with mortality (crude OR: 1.24; 95% CI 1.03-1.51; p = 0.025),
      but, when adjusted for Tn I and renal failure (as inferred by eGFR &lt;60
      ml/min/1.73 m(2)), uric acid lost its statistical significance, while Tn I
      (100 pg/ml step OR: 1.002; 95% CI 1.000-1.003; p = 0.007) and renal
      failure (OR 9.16; 95% CI 3.60-23.32; p &lt; 0.001) were independent
      predictors for in-ICCU mortality. Uric acid remained as independent
      predictor for in-ICCU complications (1 mg/dl step OR: 1.11; 95% CI
      1.01-1.21; p = 0.030) together with admission glycemia (1 g/dl step OR:
      1.50; 95% CI 1.19-1.91; p &lt; 0.001) and renal failure (OR: 1.46; 95% CI
      0.99-2.16; p &lt; 0.001). In STEMI patients submitted to PCI, increased uric
      acid levels identify a subgroup more prone to in-ICCU complications,
      probably because hyperuricemia stems from several complex mechanisms
      ranging from pre-existing risk factors to the degree of myocardial
      ischemia (as indicated by Killip class, ejection fraction) and to the
      acute metabolic response (as inferred by glucose levels). Hyperuricemia is
      not independently associated with early mortality when adjusted for renal
      function and the degree of myocardial damage.

TI  - The Strategies Used for Treatment of Experimental Autoimmune Neuritis
      (EAN): A Beneficial Effect of Glatiramer Acetate Administered
      Intraperitoneally.
AB  - Glatiramer acetate (GA) significantly ameliorates multiple sclerosis and
      was initially discovered through its effects on the animal model
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Guillain-Barre syndrome
      (GBS) is a relatively common demyelinating disease of peripheral nerves
      for which there is a parallel animal model, experimental autoimmune
      neuritis (EAN). We review the treatments found useful in EAN with special
      emphasis on the need for quick onset of action and the relevance of
      treatments used for EAE and multiple sclerosis. We evaluated the effect of
      GA administered by a novel intraperitoneal route in EAN. GA significantly
      ameliorated the severity of disease in rats (F = 6.3, p = 0.01 by analysis
      of variance (ANOVA)) and course of disease (F = 4.9, p = 0.02 by
      repeated-measures ANOVA with a day x treatment interaction term).
      Neurophysiology data supported the trend for the beneficial effect of GA.
      Myelin-induced immune cell proliferation was significantly modulated by GA
      (p &lt; 0.025). This report describes a novel route of administration of GA
      and a rapid beneficial effect of GA in EAN. GA may be useful in human
      diseases, such as GBS, where the intravenous route may offer a rapid onset
      of drug action.

TI  - beta-Adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) regulate VEGF and IL-6 production by
      divergent pathways in high beta-AR-expressing breast cancer cell lines.
AB  - Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) drives proangiogenic
      factor production in several types of cancers. To examine beta-AR
      regulation of breast cancer pathogenesis, beta-AR density, signaling
      capacity, and functional responses to beta-AR stimulation were studied in
      four human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. beta-AR density ranged from
      very low in MCF7 and MB-361 to very high in MB-231 and in a brain-seeking
      variant of MB-231, MB-231BR. Consistent with beta-AR density, beta-AR
      activation elevated cAMP in MCF7 and MB-361 much less than in MB-231 and
      MB-231BR. Functionally, beta-AR stimulation did not markedly alter
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by MCF7 or MB-361. In
      the two high beta-AR-expressing cell lines MB-231 and MB-231BR,
      beta-AR-induced cAMP and VEGF production differed considerably, despite
      similar beta-AR density. The beta(2)-AR-selective agonist terbutaline and
      the endogenous neurotransmitter norepinephrine decreased VEGF production
      by MB-231, but increased VEGF production by MB-231BR. Moreover, beta(2)-AR
      activation increased IL-6 production by both MB-231 and MB-231BR. These
      functional alterations were driven by elevated cAMP, as direct activation
      of adenylate cyclase by forskolin elicited similar alterations in VEGF and
      IL-6 production. The protein kinase A antagonist KT5720 prevented
      beta-AR-induced alterations in MB-231 and MB-231BR VEGF production, but
      not IL-6 production. Conclusions beta-AR expression and signaling is
      heterogeneous in human breast cancer cell lines. In cells with high
      beta-AR density, beta-AR stimulation regulates VEGF production through the
      classical beta-AR-cAMP-PKA pathway, but this pathway can elicit
      directionally opposite outcomes. Furthermore, in the same cells, beta-AR
      activate a cAMP-dependent, PKA-independent pathway to increase IL-6
      production. The complexity of breast cancer cell beta-AR expression and
      functional responses must be taken into account when considering beta-AR
      as a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.
