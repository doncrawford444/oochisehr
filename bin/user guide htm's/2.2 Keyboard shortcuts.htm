<h2 id="sectionHeader">2.2 Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>
Shortcut sequences allow quick navigation and selection of features.
<br><br>
Keyboard shortcuts are short keyboard combinations (see below) that allow quick selection (or triggering) of features such as: clicking a button; opening a window; or placing a cursor in a text field. Shortcut keys are indicated by an underlined character on the object's label (see fig X). The first underlined key-character on the object's name (or label) indicates the shortcut key (the first character is used unless the key is already being used as a shortcut.
<br><br>
To activate a shortcut, press the 'Alt' key and keep it pressed, then click the shortcut key, then release both buttons. The effect is the same as clicking on the object with a mouse.
<br><br>
All objects can be navigated to and selected (or triggered) using mouse or shortcut keys. Some controls may still require finer input (such as the arrow keys may be required to adjust the sliding transparency knob or to select an item from a list). Informational awareness is handled visio-spacialy with intuitive event-based work flow / manipulation using recognizable medical objects, and textual input is only necessary {{for fine-grained control and}} to record textual information. Also, complex processes can be simplified using shortcut sequences. Example: to print the clinical summary for the last chart closed: Keep 'Alt' pressed while clicking C, O, and R one-at-a-time. Click 'Enter'. Press 'Alt' + 'H' to bring up the (last) chart summary, and Ctrl + 'P' to print it.
<br><br>
Shortcut keys select or trigger objects such as a check boxes, entry fields, and buttons. While 'Alt' is pressed, clicking the shortcut key of a text field sets the cursor in the field, clicking the shortcut key of a button clicks the button, and clicking the shortcut key of a check box puts a check in the box.
<br><br>
To be enabled, a shortcut's target object must be visible on-screen or in an open window or panel.
<br><br>
Some shortcut keys are usable at any time regardless of their visibility. These shortcut keys open the five main windows and the note pad, and toggle the full-screen mode.
<br><br>
The 'Esc' key deactivates the current task. If no window is open, pressing the 'Esc' key escapes to the login-screen.
<br><br>
Alt + 'S': opens the 'System' window
Alt + 'C': opens the 'Charting' window
Alt + 'M': opens the 'Messaging' window
Alt + 'D': opens the 'Decision Support' window
Alt + 'P': opens the 'Practice' window
Alt + 'N': opens the 'Note pad'
Alt + 'F': Toggles between full-screen and windowed modes. By going between full-screen and windowed modes, other applications may be used at the same time. This feature is used mostly to manually transfer (import and export) information between applications by copying and pasting, or dragging and dropping using a mouse.
