<font color="#8B0000">'Set up'</font> ('System' &#8594 'Set up'):<br>
This feature is only available to the system administrators and users authorized with administrator privileges. 'Set up' manages network URIs and the system administrators' user names and passwords.
</p>
<p id="indentedParagraph20px">
<font color="#8B0000">'Login attempts allowed'</font> ('System' &#8594 'Set up' &#8594 'Login attempts allowed: '):<br>
There is a maximum number of 'Login attempts allowed' before the system administrator is required to login. The number of login attempts allowed is set by the system administrators in 'System' &#8594 'Set-up'. The 'Login' screen will indicate if the system administrators is required to login, and there is no limit to the number of login attempts for the system administrators. If the system administrator's user name and password does not work (fails to authenticate) for any reason, there is an emergency access method (see &quotemergency access&quot). Like the system administrators logins, there is no limit to the number of log in attempts using the emergency access method.
<br><br>
Also, the 'Login' screen's user name and password fields will both automatically clear if two minutes have elapsed without input. The clearing of fields does not count for a login attempt.
