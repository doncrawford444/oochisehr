<h2 id="sectionHeader">2.6 Charting</h2>
<p>
'Charting' contains an area for a chart (the source for EHR data) plus a menu-bar for charting controls.
<br><br>
When open, a manila chart folder with attached pages is displayed immediately below the window's talk-back bar. When a chart is not open, the chart is removed from the window and the charting window's content area is intentionally left blank.
<br><br>
The chart cover, the forms, and the detailed pages all use standard graphical widgets encapsulated separately from precisely, the same health data (see, &quotObject-universe&quot).
<br><br>
Chart sections are divided into forms, and detailed pages. All patient health information is displayed or referenced on the chart's printable, detailed pages. The form pages should also be printed, as they contain the chart's practice-specified demographic and insurance information, while the chart cover provides convenient patient identification.
<br><br>
Forms display EHR content from user input, and content descriptions from vocabulary-defined (medically &quotcoded&quot) definitions. The purpose of forms are to communicate needed health information without complex meaning or the danger of information overload. Forms display the descriptions of expected information, the actual information (data, or content) may or may not be present alongside the descriptions, providing a practice-specified view, or orientation (if the template has entries for orders).
<br><br>
Details are what are recorded when an item's data are entered, or when an event occurs (such as receiving a new patient, a name change, or an appointment).
<br><br>
Navigating through a Oochis EHR chart is as intuitive as through a paper chart with the added bonuses of faster navigation, better clarity, and a search function. Chart information is contained in five sections:
<ul>
   <li>Chart cover: contains summary patient information; may include a photo.</li>
   <li>Demographics: contains patient's demographics.</li>
   <li>Activities: contains all (new) patient's medical orders not placed in the history section.</li>
   <li>History: contains all patient's medical orders not in the activity section.</li>
   <li>Insurance: contains patient's insurance information.</li>
<ul>
