<font color="#8B0000">'Rules'</font> ('Decision Support' &#8594 'Rules'):<br>
The Rules feature sends alerts (electronic alerts similar to emails) to users if specified conditions are met (such as recommended screenings or vaccinations).
<br><br>
'Rules' are heuristics, or logarithms to perturb medical information technology processes toward a specific aim, benefit, or increase in knowledge. An alert is an unexpected automated or unexpected machine-generated intervention in human work flow and reason (for the alert). Therefore, if a condition is met, that it constitutes an alert must be programmed; and the recorded conditions and attributes of the triggering event, are used in the alert to notify a responsible provider.
<br><br>
Example: If patients under the age of 3 and whose address is in the city, &quotLivingston,&quot have not received a specific biological then alert the primary care provider to treat with shots.
