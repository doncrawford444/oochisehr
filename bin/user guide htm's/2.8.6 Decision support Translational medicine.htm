<font color="#8B0000">'Translational Medicine'</font> ('Decision Support' &#8594 'Translational Medicine'):<br>
Translational medicine is a dogmatic bench-to-bedside and bedside-to-bench feature that suggests therapies based on molecular networks that associate with a patient's medically encoded information.
<br><br>
Translational medicine attains to provide Clinicians with practical knowledge from basic biological research (and vice versus per se). Currently, the most-used example of translational medicine is the PubMed search service from the National Library of Medicine (NLM: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). PubMed is the browser's default homepage.
<br><br>
'Translational Medicine' assembles and displays the molecular pathways existing in articles containing the descriptions encoded in a set of medically entries.
<br><br>
It is reasonable to include the dogmatic text-mined co-occuring functionality of translational medicine to aid in existing pharmacological interventions; the legitamacy of the application being self-evident (or not) in the papers where the biomolecular networks were found. The shear volume of information, the accessibility to this information, and the EHR technology has only come about recently to reliably and efficiently provide this feature.
<br><br>
<ul>
   <li>Verify the patient's presentations (encoded content used to extrapolate the therapy's pharmaceutical therapy pathway intervention) as associated with the molecular network.</li>
   <li>Establish if the pharmaceutical therapy is possible for the patient.</li>
   <li>Verify that the displayed molecular associations that co-occur with the medical code descriptions are the literary-associated molecular pathways. If the pharmaceutical therapy can affect the patient's disease-associated pathway, and the symptoms that the patient has are understandable in context of the physiological state of the patient's disease presentations/ are treated by the {prescription}, the treating clinician can reasonably be expected to prescribe the drug. - moreover considered obliged to prescribe the drug out of moral obligation. What makes this easy are the recent ... {three technologies elsewhere in paper} to do so combined with the automated submittal to the deciding physician combined with the journal articles that completely describes a novel et. de nova treatable disease nosologies.</li>
</ul>
(That) the set of medical codes used to abstract a set of molecular associations are, in fact, the literary-associated molecular pathways. Moreover, the physical networks returned may present a single reasonable disease-causing molecular pathway that better describes the agent (perturbed or disease-associated molecular pathway) associated with the patient's presentations...
<br><br>
The pathway may be activated in response to an exogenous threat or may be a positive-feedback loop gone awry in the immune system. However, the presentation of hitherto-fore unavailable literary-associated and patient-unique biomolecular pathways taken from the patient's diagnostic narrative content (including encoded descriptions) may help pinpoint patient-novel molecular targets of interventions, as well as available intervention strategies (see fig. Displaying possible patient-novel interventions in the 'Translational Medicine panel').
<br><br>
'Translational Medicine' provides automated information on patient specific disease nosology (the proximate, or &quotphysical,&quot epidemiological causation of disease) grounded in the nanoscale* through molecular associations. These associations are pathway nodes - both disease and wild type - that exist in both the patient's medically encoded content (diagnoses (ICD) and procedures (CPT) in PubMed) and full-text articles in the National Library of Medicine.

<br><br>
First, diagnostic (ICD), procedural (CPT), demographic (HL7), molecular targets (e.g., &quotinsulin,&quot &quotpenicillin&quot), and custom search terms are used to search the NLM's PubMed database for journal articles/articles. Second, molecular associations are abstracted out of these articles and assembled into pathways (see figure below).

<br><br>
Green lines are pathways found co-occurring with the query submissions (search terms and/or the patient's presentations). Also, dropping (in, &quotdragging and dropping&quot) a 'Chart' onto the 'Decision support' 'Translational medicine' panel causes the chart's activities to be dropped into the query box. A white line signifies an intervention (usually pharmacogenetic, or, &quotprescriptorial&quot) in the pathway that is or was in clinical trials.
<br><br>
A yellow line signifies molecular associations that do not co-occur with the patient's presentations, yet connect green pathways together.
<br><br>
An orange line signifies a pathway intervention in the meta-pathway-whose reference does not contain query submissions.
