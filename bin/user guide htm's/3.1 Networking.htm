<h2 id="sectionHeader">3.1 Networking</h2>
<p>
To network, install Oochis EHR on each networked device using the same system administrator user name and password. Enter the same network directory in 'System' → 'Set up' → 'Program directory URI: '. Integrating beyond this may require programming (see 'CORBA integration').

Biomedical informatics consulting and medical software vending are both undergoing a paradigm shift. The marketed solution is no longer rolling implementations of software frameworks that manage an otherwise overly complex ad hoc systems and networks. The CHIS/EHR paradigm architecture's architecture's network (part is Internet) and tools have now been adopted by most providers. CHISs and EHRs are all accessible, and use the same protocols to communicate, moreover, may be accessed by any HIS software in practice. For example, and depending on regulations, a health care provider may use the CHIS/EHR paradigm or a health organization's private network, but more often, what is actually used (and despite administrative well-wishers) an ad hoc network within the GHIS/CHIS/EHR framework.
<br><br>
Due to the ubiquitous existence of the Internet, all health IT networks are effectively on the same parent network, the Global Health Information System: the largest physical network one may assemble a (smaller) network from.
<br><br>
The semantics of using the CHIS.EHR paradigm removes any layers of proprietary software frameworks - understood (not likely) and otherwise.
<br><br>
Since the establishment of the CHIS/EHR framework, defining a health network has primarily become a matter of semantics and approving access rights for users. The {{general professional practice sentiment}} is moving from complex, unintuitive, and expensive implementation and, &quotintegration support,&quot and towards straightforward distribution and, &quottech support,&quot of complete EHR solution applications.
<br><br>
Special, devoted, or closed proprietary systems using one or more of these knowledge domains need to integrate with EHR data (on the GHIS) using standard data exchange protocols in order to perform subsequent data mining, reduce complexity, save time, energy, and money. The EHR paradigm is in fact, a force multiplier in health care now. Concomitant with advancing medical treatments that affect lifespan, the HIS is geared towards a single transmutable distributed global, health providing paradigm poised to efficiently increase the average human quality and length of life. All other factors being equal, the new HIS is the greatest catalyst to world peace and prosperity, ever. Providers ascribing to this system may provide faster, more comprehensive (due to DS), safer, services. The open HIS/CHIS health care paradigm is designed to increases provider proficiency system-wide; concomitantly, provider prosperity may well depend on how much one leverages the new system rather than pretending.
<br><br>
Empirically, having a viable proprietary health solution (program, system) in today's world means adding a proprietary software component to the non-proprietary CHIS/EHR framework.
<br><br>
Oochis EHR networks using Internet protocols. Each networked Oochis EHR installation shares a virtual network directory with each other networked installation. In this network directory is an encrypted oochis_system.dat file.
<br><br>
Global messaging standards (now) allow computers to freely exchange information between patients and health care providers. Each time medical entries are signed, all the associated medical data become available on the global health information network (secured area of the Internet). Physically distinct (separated) health care networks no longer exist at the practical level, and data formats, data exchange, and messaging protocols are now standardized across health care.
<br><br>
The same Oochis EHR program may be installed on several computers to form a network, but only one Oochis EHR program may be installed on any one computer at one time.
<br><br>
Networked Oochis EHR installations form, &quotCommunity Health Networks [CHiNs],&quot. However, a health network may be arbitrarily named, and as simple as a patient, a prescribing clinician, and a pharmacy, or as complex as that formed between an organization's required and preferred service providers. Health networking protocols and medical vocabularies are globally standardized using: HL7 messaging exchange standard; import and export of CCR and CDA files, and custom hosting connections (i.e., SureScripts).
