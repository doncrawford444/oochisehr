<p>
EHR solutions are components in the HIS model (the medical information technology medical professionals use to treat patients). The EHR solution is the recording component entailing both the primary user interface and machine instructions (programming) for recording provider and patient health information.
<br><br>
Clinicians are being empowered to leverage EHR data according to their own wants and needs. Yet limit the number of components, standards, and protocols to the minimum necessary to complete the job. Creating one's own provider HIS is now and in the future, a buyers market. Leverage the new and free robust standards and protocols, and select components (like specific EHR solutions) according to one's own needs and wants.
<br><br>
While the new CHIS/EHR paradigm architecture increases proficiency system-wide, the EHR component increases individual provider proficiency.
<br><br>
Whereas once a customized HIS solutions came from monolithic system creation and implementation projects by administrations from hospitals groups, health maintenance organizations, and expert consultants, however, now a simple requirements document can often suffice to complete tasks and project deliverables, now - as well as in the forseeable future.
