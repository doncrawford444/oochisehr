Permission is hereby granted in perpetuity, without payment of license fees or 
royalties, to use, copy, or distribute the RELMA(r) program, RELMA(r) Users' 
Manual, RELMA(r) Release Notes, RELMA(r) database, LOINC(r) codes, LOINC(r) 
Users' Guide, LOINC(r) table (in all formats in which it is distributed by 
Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the LOINC Committee), LOINC(r) Release Notes, 
LOINC(r) Changes File, LOINC(r) panels and forms file, and LOINC(r) 
hierarchies file (collectively, the "Licensed Materials") for any commercial 
or non-commercial purpose, subject to the following terms and conditions:
      
      1)	To prevent the dilution of the purpose of the LOINC codes and LOINC 
table of providing a definitive standard for identifying clinical information 
in electronic reports, users shall not use any of the Licensed Materials for 
the purpose of developing or promulgating a different standard for identifying 
patient observations, such as laboratory test results; other diagnostic service 
test results; clinical observations and measurements; reports produced by 
clinicians and diagnostic services about patients; panels, forms and 
collections that define aggregations of these observations; and orders for 
these entities  in electronic reports and messages.

      2)	If the user elects to utilize the RELMA program, users receive the 
full RELMA database with the RELMA program, including the LOINC table and other 
database tables comprising the RELMA database.  In addition to its use with 
the RELMA program, users may use the LOINC table by itself and may modify the 
LOINC table as permitted herein.  Users may not use or modify the other 
database tables from the RELMA database except in conjunction with their 
authorized use of the RELMA program, unless prior written permission is granted 
by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc.  To request written permission, please 
contact loinc@regenstrief.org.

      3)	Users shall not change the meaning of any of the LOINC codes.  
Users shall not change the name of, or any contents of, any fields in the 
LOINC table.  Users may add new fields to the LOINC table to attach additional 
information to existing LOINC records.  Users shall not change the content or 
structure of the LOINC panels and forms from the LOINC panels and forms file, 
but may notify the Regenstrief Institute of any potential inconsistencies or 
corrections needed by contacting loinc@regenstrief.org. 

      4)	A user may delete records from the LOINC table to deal with the 
user's local requirements.  A user also may add new records to the LOINC table 
to deal with the users' local requirements, provided that if new records are 
added, any new entry in the LOINC_NUM field (field #1) of such new records 
must contain a leading alphabetic "X" so that the new codes and records cannot 
be confused with existing LOINC codes or new LOINC codes as they are defined 
in later releases of the LOINC table.  Records deleted or added by users to 
deal with local requirements are not reflected in the official LOINC table 
maintained by the Regenstrief Institute and the LOINC Committee.  Users must 
also make reasonable efforts to submit requests to LOINC for new records to 
cover observations that are not found in the LOINC table in order to minimize 
the need for X-codes.

      5)	LOINC codes and other information from the LOINC table may be used 
in electronic messages for laboratory test results and clinical observations 
such as HL7 ORU messages, without the need to include this Copyright Notice 
and License or a reference thereto in the message (and without the need to 
include all fields required by Section 7 hereof).  When the LOINC code (from 
the LOINC_NUM field) is included in the message, users are encouraged, 
but not required, to include the corresponding LOINC short name (from the 
SHORTNAME field) or the LOINC long common name (from the LONG_COMMON_NAME 
field) in the message if the message provides a place for a text name 
representation of the code. 

      6)	Users may make and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the 
Licensed Materials.  Each copy thereof must include this Copyright Notice and 
License, and must include the appropriate version number of the Licensed 
Materials if the Licensed Materials have a version number, or the release 
date if the Licensed Materials do not have a version number.  This Copyright 
Notice and License must appear on every printed copy of the LOINC table.  
Where the Licensed Materials are distributed on a fixed storage medium (such 
as diskette or CD-ROM), a printed copy of this Copyright Notice and License 
must be included on or with the storage medium, and a text file containing 
this information also must be stored on the storage medium in a file called 
"license.txt".  Where the Licensed Materials are distributed via the Internet, 
this Copyright Notice and License must be accessible on the same Internet page 
from which the Licensed Materials are available for download. This Copyright 
Notice and License must appear verbatim on every electronic or printed copy 
of the RELMA Users' Manual and the LOINC Users' Guide.  The RELMA Users' 
Manual and the LOINC Users' Guide may not be modified, nor may derivative 
works of the RELMA Users' Manual or LOINC Users' Guide be created, without 
the prior written permission of the Regenstrief Institute, Inc.  To request 
written permission, please contact loinc@regenstrief.org.  The Regenstrief 
Institute retains the right to approve any modification to, or derivative work 
of, the RELMA Users' Manual or the LOINC Users' Guide.

      7)	Subject to Section 1 and the other restrictions hereof, users may 
incorporate portions of the LOINC table, LOINC panels and forms file, and 
LOINC hierarchies file into another master term dictionary (e.g. laboratory 
test definition database), or software program for distribution outside of the 
user's corporation or organization, provided that any such master term 
dictionary or software program includes the following fields reproduced in 
their entirety from the LOINC table: LOINC_NUM (field #1), COMPONENT (field #2),
PROPERTY (field #3), TIME_ASPCT (field #4), SYSTEM (field #5), SCALE_TYP 
(field #6), METHOD_TYP (field #7), ANSWERLIST (field #14), STATUS (field #15), 
and SHORTNAME (field #39). Users are also required to either: (1) include the 
EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE (field #43) or (2) delete the rows that include 
third party copyrighted content (e.g., third party survey instruments 
and answers). If third party content is included, users are required to comply 
with any such third party copyright license terms. Users are encouraged, but 
not required, to also include the RelatedNames2 (field #38) and the 
LONG_COMMON_NAME (field #46) in any such database.  Further description of 
these fields is provided in Appendix A of the LOINC Users' Guide.  Every 
copy of the LOINC table, LOINC panels and forms file, and/or LOINC hierarchies 
file incorporated into or distributed in conjunction with another database or 
software program must include the following notice:

Notice of Third Party Content and Copyright Terms

A small portion of the content of the LOINC table, LOINC panels and forms, 
LOINC hierarchies, and RELMA database consists of content subject to copyright 
from third parties. This third party content is either used with permission or 
under the applicable terms of use. In all such cases, we have included the 
copyright notice. This third party content is highlighted in the program as 
follows: When such copyright content appears in the RELMA look-up grid, RELMA 
will highlight the row containing that content by printing in a different 
background color and using italics. It will also include a link in the 
(EXT (C)) column. By clicking on that link, users will get to the copyright 
notice and to the terms of use for the content of those LOINC-mapped 
terms. In the case of a LOINC table (e.g. the tab delimited file or the LOINC 
Access database) we include the copyright notice (up to 250 characters).

We have included third party content that allows use and distribution at least 
for clinical, administrative and research purposes. The third party copyright 
owners generally ask for attribution of the source, allow the free use of the 
content for treatment, health care management, and research purposes. They 
generally forbid alteration of their content (e.g., survey questions and/or 
answers) and use for commercial purpose, which usually means the direct sale 
of the survey instruments, but they often do allow use of their content in 
commercial software, medical record and other clinical database systems, and 
the messaging of patient information collected through the use of these 
instruments.  The details of the notice of copyright for any third party 
content can be found in association with the terms when using the RELMA 
look-up tool or the LOINC table. The copyright of the LOINC codes per se 
remain owned by Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the LOINC Committee and 
subject to the LOINC Copyright Notice and License.

In the future, we expect to include many more survey instruments and 
questionnaires from third parties with permission (especially those required 
by the U.S. federal government for payment and reimbursement) and believe 
that cataloguing all of these data collection forms in one comprehensive 
system (the LOINC table) along with laboratory and other clinical variables 
will facilitate the use of this data in direct clinical care, research and 
practice management.
