TI  - Akt / protein kinase B in skeletal muscle physiology and pathology.
AB  - The Akt / protein kinase B is critical regulator of cellular homeostasis
      with diminished Akt activity being associated with dysregulation of
      cellular metabolism and cell death while Akt over-activation has been
      linked to inappropriate cell growth and proliferation. Although the
      regulation of Akt function has been well characterized in vitro, much less
      is known regarding the function of Akt in vivo. Here we examine how
      skeletal muscle Akt expression and enzymatic activity are controlled, the
      role of Akt in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction, glucose
      utilization and protein metabolism, and the potential participation of
      this important molecule in skeletal muscle atrophy, aging and cancer. J.

TI  - Minimally invasive monitoring of cellulose degradation by desorption
      electrospray ionization and laser ablation electrospray ionization mass
      spectrometry.
AB  - Minimally invasive desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry
      (DESI-MS) and laser ablation electrospray ionization-MS (LAESI-MS) were
      used to look for soluble cellulose degradation products produced by
      accelerated aging in unsized cotton paper. Soluble extracts from papers
      aged 144 to 26 856 hours were first analyzed in solution using traditional
      electrospray ionization-MS (ESI-MS). Results were compared to those from
      direct analysis of condensed phase degradation products extracted from the
      absorbent paper substrate using DESI-MS and LAESI-MS. ESI-MS results
      showed evidence of oligosaccharide degradation products ranging from
      cellobiose to cellononaose; using DESI-MS and LAESI-MS, products from
      cellobiose to cellodecaose and glucose to cellooctaose, respectively, were
      observed. As degradation proceeded, increased quantities of both low and
      high molecular weight oligosaccharides were observed. The analytical
      approaches developed in the control study were applied for the detection
      of degradation products in two naturally-aged books dating from the 19th
      century, both made from cotton and linen. Oligosaccharides ranging from
      glucose to cellopentaose were observed.

TI  - Progression analysis and stage discovery in continuous physiological
      processes using image computing.
PG  - 107036
AB  - We propose an image computing-based method for quantitative analysis of
      continuous physiological processes that can be sensed by medical imaging
      and demonstrate its application to the analysis of morphological
      alterations of the bone structure, which correlate with the progression of
      osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of the analysis is to quantitatively
      estimate OA progression in a fashion that can assist in understanding the
      pathophysiology of the disease. Ultimately, the texture analysis will be
      able to provide an alternative OA scoring method, which can potentially
      reflect the progression of the disease in a more direct fashion compared
      to the existing clinically utilized classification schemes based on
      radiology. This method can be useful not just for studying the nature of
      OA, but also for developing and testing the effect of drugs and
      treatments. While in this paper we demonstrate the application of the
      method to osteoarthritis, its generality makes it suitable for the
      analysis of other progressive clinical conditions that can be diagnosed
      and prognosed by using medical imaging.

TI  - Joint aging and chondrocyte cell death.
PG  - 199-214
AB  - Articular cartilage extracellular matrix and cell function change with age
      and are considered to be the most important factors in the development and
      progression of osteoarthritis. The multifaceted nature of joint disease
      indicates that the contribution of cell death can be an important factor
      at early and late stages of osteoarthritis. Therefore, the pharmacologic
      inhibition of cell death is likely to be clinically valuable at any stage
      of the disease. In this article, we will discuss the close association
      between diverse changes in cartilage aging, how altered conditions
      influence chondrocyte death, and the implications of preventing cell loss
      to retard osteoarthritis progression and preserve tissue homeostasis.

TI  - Evaluating Convergence of Within-Person Change and Between-Person Age
      Differences in Age-Heterogeneous Longitudinal Studies.
PG  - 45-60
AB  - The distinction of between-person age differences from within-person age
      changes is necessary for understanding aging-related change processes.
      Although longitudinal studies are required to address issues relating to
      within person change, most studies begin using age-heterogeneous samples
      and conclude using survival-heterogeneous samples. Given the numerous
      potential confounds associated with age-heterogeneous samples, careful
      treatment of between-person age differences is essential to obtain the
      correct inferences regarding within-person age change. We demonstrate how
      failure to differentiate between-person age effects (and by extension, of
      survival age or other effects producing sample heterogeneity) will lead to
      uninterpretable inferences regarding within-person change. We recommend
      that convergence of age differences and age changes be formally evaluated
      whenever possible.

TI  - Oxidative stress and DNA methylation in prostate cancer.
PG  - 302051
AB  - The protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and other foods on prostate
      cancer may be due to their antioxidant properties. An imbalance in the
      oxidative stress/antioxidant status is observed in prostate cancer
      patients. Genome oxidative damage in prostate cancer patients is
      associated with higher lipid peroxidation and lower antioxidant levels.
      Oxygen radicals are associated with different steps of carcinogenesis,
      including structural DNA damage, epigenetic changes, and protein and lipid
      alterations. Epigenetics affects genetic regulation, cellular
      differentiation, embryology, aging, cancer, and other diseases. DNA
      methylation is perhaps the most extensively studied epigenetic
      modification, which plays an important role in the regulation of gene
      expression and chromatin architecture, in association with histone
      modification and other chromatin-associated proteins. This review will
      provide a broad overview of the interplay of oxidative stress and DNA
      methylation, DNA methylation changes in regulation of gene expression,
      lifestyle changes for prostate cancer prevention, DNA methylation as
      biomarkers for prostate cancer, methods for detection of methylation, and
      clinical application of DNA methylation inhibitors for epigenetic therapy.

TI  - Interleukin-6 contributes to age-related alteration of cytokine production
      by macrophages.
PG  - 475139
AB  - Here, we studied in vitro cytokine production by splenic macrophages
      obtained from young and aged BALB/c wild type (WT) and IL-6 knockout (IL-6
      KO) mice. Relative to macrophages obtained from young WT mice given
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS), those from aged WT mice had decreased production
      of proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, when compared to macrophages
      from young IL-6 KO mice, LPS stimulation yielded higher levels of these
      cytokines by cells from aged IL-6 KO mice. Aging or IL-6 deficiency did
      not affected the percentage of F4/80(+) macrophages, or the surface
      expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and components of the IL-6
      receptor. Overall, our results indicate that IL-6 plays a role in
      regulating the age-related defects in macrophages through alteration of
      proinflammatory cytokines, adding to the complexity of IL-6-mediated
      impairment of immune cell function with increasing age.

TI  - Successful cognitive and emotional aging.
PG  - 78-84
AB  - We review the definitions, determinants, and ways of enhancing successful
      cognitive and emotional aging. Objective definitions of successful aging
      based on physical health emphasize outcomes including freedom from
      disability and disease, whereas subjective definitions center on
      well-being, social connectedness, and adaptation. Most older people do not
      meet objective criteria for successful aging, while a majority meet the
      subjective criteria. Older people with severe mental illness are not
      excluded from successful aging. The determinants of successful aging
      include complex interactions of lifestyle behaviors and social environment
      with genes. Depression interferes with nearly all determinants of
      successful aging. Evidence-based means of enhancing successful aging
      include calorie restriction, physical exercise, cognitive stimulation,
      social support, and optimization of stress. Future directions for
      successful aging research and implications for geriatric psychiatry are
      discussed.

TI  - The Effect of Aging on Venous Valves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Age is the strongest risk factor for venous thrombosis. Vessel
      wall changes such as thickening of venous valves may be one of the
      contributing mechanisms. We determined thickness and function of venous
      valves in the popliteal vein with ultrasound in 77 healthy individuals.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 6 age groups ranging from 20 to 80
      years old. Thickness of the valves was compared between age groups. Valve
      closure time was assessed as an indicator for valve function. In 69 of 77
      participants, valve parameters could be measured. We found an increasing
      thickness of the valves with age, with a mean thickness of 0.35 mm (range,
      0.25 to 0.44 mm) in the group of 20 to 30 years and 0.59 mm (range, 0.30
      to 1.21 mm) in the group of 71 to 80 years. The increase in valve
      thickness per year (linear regression coefficient) was 0.004 mm (95% CI, 0
      to 0.009). Valve function was not directly associated with age. Valve
      thickness, however, was inversely associated with valve function.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that deep venous valves change with age,
      with thicker valves in older individuals. The increase of valve thickness
      with age may be part of the explanation for the age gradient seen in the
      incidence of venous thrombosis.

TI  - Transnitrosylation of XIAP Regulates Caspase-Dependent Neuronal Cell
      Death.
PG  - 184-195
AB  - X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is a potent antagonist of caspase
      apoptotic activity. XIAP also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase,
      targeting caspases for degradation. However, molecular pathways
      controlling XIAP activities remain unclear. Here, we report that nitric
      oxide (NO) reacts with XIAP by S-nitrosylating its RING domain (forming
      SNO-XIAP), thereby inhibiting E3 ligase and antiapoptotic activity.
      NO-mediated neurotoxicity and caspase activation have been linked to
      several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
      and Huntington's diseases. We find significant SNO-XIAP formation in
      brains of patients with these diseases, implicating this reaction in the
      etiology of neuronal damage. Conversely, S-nitrosylation of caspases is
      known to inhibit apoptotic activity. Unexpectedly, we find that
      SNO-caspase transnitrosylates (transfers its NO group) to XIAP, forming
      SNO-XIAP, and thus promotes cell injury and death. These findings provide
      insights into the regulation of caspase activation in neurodegenerative
      disorders mediated, at least in part, by nitrosative stress.

TI  - Male sex and smoking have a larger impact on the prevalence of colorectal
      neoplasia than family history of colorectal cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS:: Screening recommendations for colorectal cancer (CRC)
      commonly take family history, but no other risk factors, into account. We
      compared and assessed risk factors of colorectal polyps in a large
      population undergoing screening colonoscopy. METHODS:: We conducted a
      population-based cross-sectional study that included 3349 subjects, 55
      years or older in age (mean ages of men and women: 63.6 and 63.4 years),
      that underwent colonoscopy for the first time within the nationwide
      colonoscopy screening program in Germany. We calculated prevalences of
      colorectal polyps and estimated multivariate prevalence ratios (PRs) and
      population attributable fractions (PAFs). RESULTS:: Overall, 654 subjects
      had hyperplastic polyps (20%), 675 had non-advanced adenomas (20%), 343
      had advanced adenomas (10%), and 40 had CRC (1%). Risk factor prevalences
      and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) were higher for male gender and
      smoking than for a family history of CRC. PAFs for prevalence of
      non-advanced and advanced neoplasia were highest for male gender (23% and
      23%), followed by smoking (7% and 9%), and family history of CRC (2% and
      4%). DISCUSSION:: Male gender and smoking have a larger impact on the
      prevalence of colorectal neoplasia than family history, suggesting an
      extensive evaluation of additional risk stratification in population-based
      screening, particularly by sex.

TI  - Can older "at risk" adults benefit from psychoeducation targeting healthy
      brain aging?
PG  - 1-12
AB  - ABSTRACTBackground: Multifactorial strategies that prevent or delay the
      onset or progress of cognitive decline and dementia are needed, and should
      include education regarding recognized risk factors. The current study
      sought to investigate whether older adults "at risk" of cognitive decline
      benefit from psychoeducation targeting healthy brain aging.Methods: 65
      participants (mean age 64.8 years, SD 9.6) with a lifetime history of
      major depression; vascular risk as evidenced by at least one vascular risk
      factor; and/or subjective or objective memory impairment were allocated to
      weekly psychoeducation sessions or a waitlist control group. The small
      group sessions were conducted over ten weeks by a team of medical and
      allied health professionals with expertise in late-life depression and
      cognition. Sessions focused on modifiable risk factors for cognitive
      decline including vascular risk, diet, exercise, depression, anxiety and
      sleep disturbance, as well as providing practical strategies for memory
      and cognition. Both the psychoeducation and waitlist group completed a
      20-item knowledge test at baseline and follow-up. Participants in the
      psychoeducation group were asked to complete follow-up self-report
      satisfaction questionnaires.Results: Repeated measures ANOVA showed a
      significant interaction effect depicting improvements in knowledge
      associated with psychoeducation, corresponding to an improvement of 15%
      from baseline. Satisfaction data additionally showed that 92.3% of
      participants rated the program as "good" to "excellent", and over 90%
      suggested they would recommend it to others.Conclusions: A group-based
      psychoeducation program targeting healthy brain aging is effective in
      improving knowledge. Additionally, it is acceptable and rated highly by
      participants.

TI  - Changing Patterns in Medication Use with Increasing Probability of Death
      for Older Medicare Beneficiaries.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether use of symptom relief drugs (e.g.,
      antidepressants, anxiolytics, opioid analgesics, sleep aids) rises and use
      of two commonly prescribed classes of chronic medications (statins and
      osteoporosis drugs) falls with greater probability of death for older
      Medicare beneficiaries. DESIGN: Pooled cross-sectional study. SETTING:
      Noninstitutionalized older Medicare population in 2000 to 2005.
      PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older
      (N=20,233). MEASUREMENTS: Use of medications measured according to
      dichotomous flags; intensity of use by annual medication fills. Annual
      probability of death modeled using logistic regression and stratified into
      seven groups with predicted probabilities of death that range from less
      than 5% to greater than 50%. Prevalence of use and intensity (mean
      prescription fills per month) were computed for each class of medication.
      RESULTS: For symptom relief medications, there is relatively constant use
      with increasing probability of death, along with greater intensity of use.
      For the two chronic medications, there was a monotonic decrease in use but
      at a relatively constant intensity. Decline in statin use ranged from
      34.4% in the lowest mortality stratum to 17.6% for those in the highest
      (P&lt;.001). Use of osteoporosis drugs fell from 10.4% to 6.6% over the same
      range (P&lt;.001). CONCLUSION: Greater intensity of use of symptom relief
      medications with increasing probability of death is consistent with
      hypothesized use. The different profile for chronic medications suggests
      that the time to benefit is being considered regarding therapy initiation,
      which results in lower use.

TI  - Effect of Walking Distance on 8-Year Incident Depressive Symptoms in
      Elderly Men with and without Chronic Disease: The Honolulu-Asia Aging
      Study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of walking on incident depressive
      symptoms in elderly Japanese-American men with and without chronic
      disease. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Honolulu-Asia
      Aging Study. PARTICIPANTS: Japanese-American men aged 71 to 93 at
      baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity was assessed according to
      self-reported distance walked per day. Depressive symptoms were measured
      using an 11-question version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies
      Depression Scale (CES-D 11) at the fourth examination (n=3,196) and at the
      seventh examination 8 years later (1999/00, n=1,417). Presence of incident
      depressive symptoms was defined as a CES-D 11 score of 9 or greater or
      taking antidepressants at Examination 7. Subjects with prevalent
      depressive symptoms at baseline were excluded. RESULTS: Age-adjusted
      8-year incident depressive symptoms were 13.6%, 7.6%, and 8.5% for low
      (&lt;0.25 miles/day), intermediate (0.25-1.5 miles/day), and high (&gt;1.5
      miles/day) walking groups at baseline (P=0.008). Multiple logistic
      regression analyses, adjusted for age, education, marital status,
      cardiovascular risk factors, prevalent diseases, and functional
      impairment, showed that those in the intermediate and highest walking
      groups had significantly lower odds of developing 8-year incident
      depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR)=0.52, 95% confidence interval
      (CI)=0.32-0.83, P=.006 and OR=0.61, 95% CI= 0.39-0.97, P=.04,
      respectively). Analysis found that this association was significant only
      in participants without chronic diseases (coronary heart disease,
      cerebrovascular accident, cancer, Parkinson's disease, dementia, or
      cognitive impairment) at baseline. CONCLUSION: Daily physical activity
      (&gt;/=0.25 mile/day) is significantly associated with lower risk of 8-year
      incident depressive symptoms in elderly Japanese-American men without
      chronic disease at baseline.

TI  - The Effect of Medication Use on Urinary Incontinence in Community-Dwelling
      Elderly Women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether use of certain medications with potential
      urological effects is associated with development of incident urinary
      incontinence in community-resident older women. DESIGN: Longitudinal
      cohort study. SETTING: Pittsburgh, PA, and Memphis, TN. PARTICIPANTS: Nine
      hundred fifty-nine healthy black and white women aged 65 and older
      enrolled in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study without baseline
      (Year 1) self-reported urinary incontinence. MEASUREMENTS: Use of alpha
      blockers, anticholinergics, central nervous system medications (opioids,
      benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics), diuretics (thiazide,
      loop, potassium sparing), and estrogen (all dosage forms) was determined
      during Year 3 interviews. Self-reported incident (&gt;/=weekly) incontinence
      in during the previous 12 months was assessed at Year 4 interviews.
      RESULTS: Overall, 20.5% of these women reported incident incontinence at
      Year 4 (3 years from baseline). The most common medication used with
      potential urological activity was a thiazide diuretic (24.3%), followed by
      estrogen (22.2%); alpha blockers were the least commonly used (2.3%).
      Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that current users of
      alpha blockers (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=4.98, 95% confidence interval
      (CI)=1.96-12.64) and estrogen (AOR=1.60, 95% CI=1.08-2.36) had a greater
      risk of urinary incontinence than nonusers. There was no greater risk
      (P&gt;.05) of urinary incontinence with the current use of anticholinergics,
      central nervous system medications, or diuretics. No statistically
      significant race-by-medication use interactions were found (all P&gt;.05).
      CONCLUSION: These results corroborate earlier reports that, in elderly
      women, use of alpha blockers or estrogens is associated with risk of
      self-reported incident urinary incontinence.

TI  - ALDOSE REDUCTASE AND AGE-RAGE PATHWAYS: CENTRAL ROLES IN THE PATHOGENESIS
      OF VASCULAR DYSFUNCTION IN AGING RATS.
AB  - Summary Aging is inevitably accompanied by gradual and irreversible innate
      endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that
      accentuation of glucose metabolism via the aldose reductase (AR) pathway
      contributes to age-related vascular dysfunction. AR protein and activity
      levels were significantly increased in aged vs. young aortic homogenates
      from Fischer 344 rats. Immunostaining revealed that the principal site of
      increased AR protein was the aortic endothelium as well as smooth muscle
      cells. Studies revealed that endothelial-dependent relaxation (EDR) in
      response to acetylcholine was impaired in aged rats compared to young
      rats, and that treatment with the AR inhibitor (ARI) zopolrestat
      significantly improved EDR in aged rats. Methylglyoxal (MG), a key
      precursor of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs), was significantly
      increased in the aortas of aged rats vs young rats. Consistent with
      central roles for AR in generation of MG in aging, ARI treatment
      significantly reduced MG levels in aged rat aorta to those in young rats.
      Treatment of aged rats with soluble(s) RAGE, a soluble form of the chief
      signal transduction receptor for AGEs, RAGE, significantly improved EDR in
      aged rats, thus establishing the contribution of age-related increases in
      AGEs to endothelial dysfunction. These findings reveal that significant
      increases in AR expression and activity in aged rat vasculature linked to
      endothelial dysfunction may be mitigated, at least in part, via ARI and
      that aging-linked increased flux via AR generates AGEs; species which
      transduce endothelial injury consequent to their interaction with RAGE.
      These data demonstrate for the first time that AR mediates aging-related
      vascular dysfunction, at least in part, via RAGE.

TI  - G-quadruplex nucleic acids and human disease.
AB  - Alternate DNA structures that deviate from B-form double-stranded DNA such
      as G-quadruplex (G4) DNA can be formed by sequences that are widely
      distributed throughout the human genome. G-quadruplex secondary
      structures, formed by the stacking of planar quartets composed of four
      guanines that interact by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, can affect cellular
      DNA replication and transcription, and influence genomic stability. The
      unique metabolism of G-rich chromosomal regions that potentially form
      quadruplexes may influence a number of biological processes including
      immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, promoter activation and telomere
      maintenance. A number of human diseases are characterized by telomere
      defects, and it is proposed that G-quadruplex structures which form at
      telomere ends play an important role in telomere stability. Evidence from
      cellular studies and model organisms suggests that diseases with known
      defects in G4 DNA helicases are likely to be perturbed in telomere
      maintenance and cellular DNA replication. In this minireview, we discuss
      the connections of G-quadruplex nucleic acids to human genetic diseases
      and cancer based on the recent literature.

TI  - Male menopause: is it a real clinical syndrome?
AB  - The association between aging-related testosterone deficiency and
      late-onset clinical hypogonadism in men remains a controversial concept.
      Several descriptive names, such as andropause, male menopause, partial
      androgen deficiency of the aging male and late-onset hypogonadism, have
      been suggested in an attempt to connect the age-related decline in
      androgen production and symptoms of aging in men. However, despite many
      studies, no clear correlation has been established and, as a result, there
      is also a debate over the use of androgen replacement therapy in this
      clinical set-up. Nevertheless, new data from large-scale studies have been
      recently published, which shed more light on this complicated issue. A
      recent New England Journal of Medicine article demonstrated that only a
      minor fraction (2%) of elderly men suffer from this clinical syndrome and
      gave serum testosterone level thresholds that support it.

TI  - The correlation between clinical laboratory data and telomeric status of
      male patients with metabolic disorders and no clinical history of vascular
      events.
AB  - The telomere length and subtelomeric methylated status of peripheral blood
      leukocytes has been reported to be correlated with many kinds of
      pathophysiological conditions. However, the correlation between the
      telomeric parameters and clinical laboratory data in metabolic disorders
      is not well known. This study investigated the correlation between the
      telomere length and subtelomeric methylated status in peripheral
      leukocytes and the laboratory data of male outpatients with combined
      metabolic disorders and no clinical history of cardiovascular or
      cerebrovascular event were assessed, to find good clinical laboratory
      markers reflecting the biological aging. The laboratory data were
      collected in 26 Japanese male outpatients with diabetes mellitus and
      hyperlipidemia, and no history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event,
      and the telomeric parameters in their peripheral leukocytes were
      determined by Southern blot with methylation-sensitive and insensitive
      isoschizomers. Any correlations between the laboratory data and the
      telomeric parameters were assessed. The patients showed a significant
      negative correlation among the bilirubin and creatine phosphokinase with
      the aging-associate change of the telomeric and subtelomeric parameters.
      Lowered serum bilirubin and creatinine phosphokinase level correlated to
      genomic aging represented by telomere attrition of patients with metabolic
      disorders.

AB  - Family caregivers need assistance with information, support, and advice
      from nurses and other health care professionals to successfully meet the
      demands of caregiving. Self-Care TALK (SCT) is a theory-based nursing
      intervention designed to improve the health and well-being of older adult
      spouse caregivers. The Self-Care for Health Promotion in Aging Model
      (S-CHPA) provides a framework for development of SCT. Key to
      implementation of the SCT intervention is partnership building between
      nurses and caregivers, which is fostered through relational conversations.
      In this article, the model and intervention are described, and an
      individual example is provided to show the application of the model in
      practice. Implications for practice and research are explored.

      chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
AB  - Although endoscopy with biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this procedure is invasive and its
      repetition is stressful, especially in children. The purpose of this study
      was to evaluate prospectively the role of (99m)Tc-HMPAO-labeled
      granulocyte scintigraphy in the diagnosis and follow-up of pediatric IBD
      and its possible use as an alternative to colonoscopy to determine the
      disease extent and severity beyond its ability to differentiate ulcerative
      colitis from Crohn's disease. During a 10-year period, 52 children, aging
      between 2 and 17 years (median, 11.09 years), were subjected to
      (99m)Tc-HMPAO granulocyte scan 7-28 days from conventional diagnostic
      tests, and the results were compared with endoscopic and bioptic results.
      Disease severity was graded by the focal uptake intensity versus iliac
      bone uptake (Scan Activity Index) and compared with Endoscopy Mayo Score.
      In 15 out of 16 patients, IBD diagnosis was obtained with a full
      correspondence of location and severity of lesions, respectively, in 14
      out of 16 and 13 out of 16, while in 31 out of 36 patients, IBD was
      correctly excluded (sensitivity of 93.7%, specificity of 86.1%, and
      negative predictive value of 96.4%). During the follow-up, all relapses
      (24) and remissions (13) were correctly recognized (sensibility and
      specificity of 100%). In conclusion, (99m)Tc-HMPAO granulocyte scan is an
      accurate minimally invasive technique with very good accuracy, able to
      diagnose and to grade the intensity and extent of the disease; it is also
      a useful tool in the follow-up of pediatric IBD where it could reliably
      replace the invasive endoscopic assessment in most cases.

AB  - Background: The effects of aging on people must be evaluated to adequate
      sanitary actions. Aim: To assess the characteristics of older subjects
      living in Antofagasta, Chile. Material and Methods: Cross sectional
      assessment of 602 subjects without dementia, aged more than 60 years (55%
      females). A socioeconomic and medical history was obtained and Barthel,
      Lawton, Yesavage depression, Tromp fall risk and Folstein Mini mental
      scales were applied. Results: Sixty eight percent of subjects had more
      than six years of studies. Forty six percent had hypertension, 28% had
      osteoarticular problems, 20% had hypercholesterolemia and 17% diabetes
      mellitus. Four percent had depression and falls were reported by 35%.
      Seventy four percent were independent in basic and instrumental
      activities. Ninety four percent had normal cognitive functions. Age was an
      important determinant of functional capacity. Conclusions: The main
      problems detected in this sample were the risk of falls and the presence
      of chronic diseases.

PG  - 397-400
AB  - The third version of the World Kidney Day will be held on May 13, 2010 in
      Chile and will be focused in diabetic renal damage, the main cause of
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Currently, we are living a pandemia of CKD,
      a progressive and irreversible condition with high social and economic
      impact. In Chile, we have 857 patients per million inhabitants in
      hemodialysis and 35% are secondary to diabetes. Our general prevalence of
      diabetes is 4.2%, rising to 15% in people aged more than 64 years. With a
      34% prevalence of hypertension, an aging population, high prevalence of
      obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle, there is an estimation of a rise in
      85% of the prevalence of diabetes in South-America, for the next decades.
      The steps to be taken are clear: campaigns should be aimed at (1)
      prevention of type 2 diabetes; (2) screening for early diabetic kidney
      disease; (3) increasing patient awareness of kidney disease; (4) using
      medications of proven strategy and fnally (5) research on new therapies.
      These concepts must be included in community and professional education to
      reduce the effects of this pandemia.

TI  - Update on current and emerging treatment options for post-polio syndrome.
PG  - 307-13
AB  - Post-polio syndrome (PPS) refers to the clinical deterioration experienced
      by many polio survivors several decades after their acute illness. The
      symptoms are new muscle weakness, decreased muscle endurance, fatigue,
      muscle pain, joint pain, cold intolerance, and this typical clinical
      entity is reported from different parts of the world. The pathophysiology
      behind PPS is not fully understood, but a combination of distal
      degeneration of enlarged motor units caused by increased metabolic demands
      and the normal aging process, in addition to inflammatory mechanisms, are
      thought to be involved. There is no diagnostic test for PPS, and the
      diagnosis is based on a proper clinical workup where all other possible
      explanations for the new symptoms are ruled out. The basic principle of
      management of PPS lies in physical activity, individually tailored
      training programs, and lifestyle modification. Muscle weakness and muscle
      pain may be helped with specific training programs, in which training in
      warm water seems to be particularly helpful. Properly fitted orthoses can
      improve the biomechanical movement pattern and be energy-saving. Fatigue
      can be relieved with lifestyle changes, assistive devices, and training
      programs. Respiratory insufficiency can be controlled with noninvasive
      respiratory aids including biphasic positive pressure ventilators.
      Pharmacologic agents like prednisone, amantadine, pyridostigmine, and
      coenzyme Q10 are of no benefit in PPS. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
      has been tried in three studies, all having positive results. IVIG could
      probably be a therapeutic alternative, but the potential benefit is
      modest, and some important questions are still unanswered, in particular
      to which patients this treatment is useful, the dose, and the therapeutic
      interval.

TI  - A Subset of Osteoblasts Expressing High Endogenous Levels of PPARgamma
      Switches Fate to Adipocytes in the Rat Calvaria Cell Culture Model.
PG  - e11782
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding fate choice and fate switching between the
      osteoblast lineage (ObL) and adipocyte lineage (AdL) is important to
      understand both the developmental inter-relationships between osteoblasts
      and adipocytes and the impact of changes in fate allocation between the
      two lineages in normal aging and certain diseases. The goal of this study
      was to determine when during lineage progression ObL cells are susceptible
      to an AdL fate switch by activation of endogenous peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
      FINDINGS: Multiple rat calvaria cells within the ObL developmental
      hierarchy were isolated by either fractionation on the basis of expression
      of alkaline phosphatase or retrospective identification of single
      cell-derived colonies, and treated with BRL-49653 (BRL), a synthetic
      ligand for PPARgamma. About 30% of the total single cell-derived colonies
      expressed adipogenic potential (defined cytochemically) when BRL was
      present. Profiling of ObL and AdL markers by qRT-PCR on amplified cRNA
      from over 160 colonies revealed that BRL-dependent adipogenic potential
      correlated with endogenous PPARgamma mRNA levels. Unexpectedly, a
      significant subset of relatively mature ObL cells exhibited
      osteo-adipogenic bipotentiality. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry
      confirmed that ObL cells co-expressed multiple mesenchymal lineage
      determinants (runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), PPARgamma, Sox9
      and MyoD which localized in the cytoplasm initially, and only Runx2
      translocated to the nucleus during ObL progression. Notably, however, some
      cells exhibited both PPARgamma and Runx2 nuclear labeling with concomitant
      upregulation of expression of their target genes with BRL treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that not only immature but a subset
      of relatively mature ObL cells characterized by relatively high levels of
      endogenous PPARgamma expression can be switched to the AdL. The fact that
      some ObL cells maintain capacity for adipogenic fate selection even at
      relatively mature developmental stages implies an unexpected plasticity
      with important implications in normal and pathological bone development.

TI  - Patrimony and the evolution of risk-taking.
PG  - e11656
AB  - The propensity to make risky choices has a genetic component, and recent
      studies have identified several specific genes that contribute to this
      trait. Since risk-taking often appears irrational or maladaptive, the
      question arises how (or if) natural selection favors risk-taking. Here we
      show, using a stochastic simulation of selection between two hypothetical
      species, "R" (risk-seeking) and "A" (risk-averse) that, when expected
      reproductive fitness of the individual is unaffected by the making of the
      risky choice (winnings balanced by losses) natural selection (taken to the
      point of extinction) favors the risk-averse species. However, the
      situation is entirely reversed if offspring are permitted to inherit a
      small fraction of the parent's increased or decreased fitness acquired
      through risk-taking. This seemingly Lamarckian form of inheritance
      actually corresponds to the human situation when property or culture are
      transmitted in families. In the presence of this "cultural inheritance",
      the long-shot risk-taking species was overwhelmingly favored, even when
      90% of individuals were rendered sterile by a losing choice. Given this
      strong effect in a minimal model, it is important to consider the
      co-evolution of genes and culture when interpreting the genetics of
      risk-taking. This conclusion applies, in principle, to any species where
      parental resources can directly affect the fecundity of offspring. It
      might also be relevant to the effects of epigenetic inheritance, if the
      epigenetic state of zygotes can be affected by parental experiences.

TI  - Reversal of Age-associated Oxidative Stress in Rats by MRN-100, a
      Hydro-ferrate Fluid.
PG  - 525-33
AB  - Aging is associated with an increase in the level of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS), which cause cellular damage. This study examined the
      protective effects of MRN-100, an iron-based hydro-ferrate fluid, against
      age-associated oxidative stress using young (4 months old) and aged (22
      months old) rats. The effect of MRN-100 intake on lipid peroxidation,
      protein oxidation, and antioxidant status was studied in the blood, liver,
      and brain. Aged rats were treated with tap water or MRN-100 (100%) orally
      daily for 40 days. Results revealed that in aged rats treated with MRN-100
      (100%) there was: (i) an inhibition of the levels of oxidative stress
      biomarkers: malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, protein carbonyl groups and
      total free radicals; (ii) an augmentation in glutathione and total thiol
      contents; (iii) an enhancement in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes
      superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase; and (iv) an
      enhancement in plasma iron and ferritin concentrations, and in transferrin
      saturation. MRN-100 reversed age-related oxidative changes, bringing
      levels to within the limits of the young control rats in the blood, liver
      and brain. MRN-100 showed effectiveness in modulating age-associated
      oxidative stress in rats, and it may therefore be useful to reduce
      age-associated disorders where free radicals and oxidative stress are the
      major cause.

TI  - Type of cell death induced by various metal cations in cultured human
      gingival fibroblasts.
PG  - 513-7
AB  - Metal ions are released from casting alloys and cause damage to cell
      structures and local inflammation. However, the cytotoxic mechanism and
      the type of cell death induced in human gingival fibroblast (HGF) by
      contact with dental metals have not been well characterized. Here the
      cytotoxicity of eight metals against HGF was investigated. Cytoxicity of
      metals against HGF was in the following order: Ag(NH(3))(2)F (most
      cytotoxic)&gt;AgCl&gt;CuCl(2)&gt;CuCl, CoCl(2)&gt; NiCl(2)&gt;FeCl(2), FeCl(3) (least
      cytotoxic). None of the metals showed any apparent hormetic growth
      stimulation at lower concentrations, except for Ag(NH(3))(2)F at 20 or
      higher population-doubling level of HGF. The sensitivity of HGF against
      Ag(NH(3))(2)F was reduced during in vitro aging, similar to previous
      report with sodium fluoride. Contact with Ag(NH(3))(2)F for only one hour
      induced irreversible cell death, whereas longer duration of contact with
      AgCl or CuCl(2) was necessary to induce irreversible cell death. These
      metals induced neither DNA fragmentation nor caspase-3 activation.
      Pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) and autophagy inhibitors
      (3-methyladenine, bafilomycin) did not apparently affect the cytotoxicity
      of metals, when corrected for the effect of inhibitor alone on growth. We
      also found that Ag(NH(3))(2)F induced much higher cytotoxicity than AgCl
      in mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, possibly inducing necrosis.
      These data suggest the importance of cautious application of Ag(NH(3))(2)F
      to the oral cavity.

TI  - A possible mechanism for altered immune response in the elderly.
PG  - 471-87
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reciprocal influences and bidirectional connections among the
      nervous, endocrine and immune systems, mediated by shared neuroendocrine
      hormones, chemo/cytokines and binding sites contribute to the maintainment
      of body homeostasis. The hypothalamus-pituitary axis may play an
      immunomodulating role and influence cellular immune responses by releasing
      various hormones and neuropeptides into the blood with direct modulatory
      action on the immune effectors, or by regulating the hormonal secretion of
      peripheral endocrine glands. Aging is associated with changes in immune
      function. The aim of this study was to evaluate circadian variations of
      some endocrine and immune factors in the elderly. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Serum levels of cortisol, melatonin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH),
      thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT(4)), growth hormone
      (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 and interleukin (IL) 2 were
      measured and lymphocyte subpopulation analyses were performed on blood
      samples collected every four hours for 24 hours from ten healthy young and
      middle-aged individuals (age 35-54 years) and from ten healthy elderly
      individuals (age 65-76 years). RESULTS: There was a statistically
      significant difference between the groups in the observed values of CD20
      and TSH serum levels (higher in the young and middle-aged) and CD25 and
      DR(+) T-cells (higher in the elderly). In the group of young and middle
      aged subjects, a clear circadian rhythm was validated for the
      time-qualified changes of all the factors studied, with the exception of
      FT(4), IGF1 and IL2. In the group of elderly individuals, a number of
      rhythms and correlations with neuroendocrine hormones were absent or
      altered. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study evidence
      aging-associated decrease of peripheral B-cell compartment, increase of
      activated T-cell compartment, decrease of hypophyseal thyrotropin
      secretion, altered circadian rhythmicity and altered hormone-immune cell
      correlations.

TI  - SIRT1 Promotes the Central Adaptive Response to Diet Restriction through
      Activation of the Dorsomedial and Lateral Nuclei of the Hypothalamus.
PG  - 10220-32
AB  - Diet restriction retards aging and extends lifespan by triggering adaptive
      mechanisms that alter behavioral, physiological, and biochemical responses
      in mammals. Little is known about the molecular pathways evoking the
      corresponding central response. One factor that mediates the effects of
      diet restriction is the mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      (NAD)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Here we demonstrate that diet
      restriction significantly increases SIRT1 protein levels and induces
      neural activation in the dorsomedial and lateral hypothalamic nuclei.
      Increasing SIRT1 in the brain of transgenic (BRASTO) mice enhances neural
      activity specifically in these hypothalamic nuclei, maintains a higher
      range of body temperature, and promotes physical activity in response to
      different diet-restricting paradigms. These responses are all abrogated in
      Sirt1-deficient mice. SIRT1 upregulates expression of the orexin type 2
      receptor specifically in these hypothalamic nuclei in response to
      diet-restricting conditions, augmenting response to ghrelin, a gut hormone
      whose levels increase in these conditions. Our results suggest that in the
      hypothalamus, SIRT1 functions as a key mediator of the central response to
      low nutritional availability, providing insight into the role of the
      hypothalamus in the regulation of metabolism and aging in mammals.

TI  - Chromosomal location-dependent nonstochastic onset of odor receptor
      expression.
PG  - 10067-75
AB  - As odorant receptors (ORs) are thought to be critical determinants of
      olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axon targeting and organization, we
      examined the spatiotemporal onset of mice ORs expression from the
      differentiation of OSNs in the olfactory placode to an aging olfactory
      epithelium. ORs were first detected in the placode at embryonic day 9
      (E9), at the onset of OSN differentiation but before axon extension. By
      E13, 22 of 23 ORs were expressed. Onset of individual OR expression was
      diverse; levels and patterns of expression were unique for each OR.
      Regional distribution of ORs within zones of the olfactory epithelium
      appeared stable across development; adult-like patterns were observed by
      E13. Finally, analysis of OR expression and chromosomal location suggests
      that ORs are not stochastically expressed; they show evidence of
      coordinated expression. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that ORs
      are not equally represented in the "olfactome" across an animal's
      lifespan.

TI  - Amyloid {beta} Precursor Protein Regulates Male Sexual Behavior.
PG  - 9967-72
AB  - Sexual behavior is variable between individuals, ranging from celibacy to
      sexual addictions. Within normal populations of individual men, ranging
      from young to middle aged, testosterone levels do not correlate with
      libido. To study the genetic mechanisms that contribute to individual
      differences in male sexual behavior, we used hybrid B6D2F1 male mice,
      which are a cross between two common inbred strains (C57BL/6J and DBA/2J).
      Unlike most laboratory rodent species in which male sexual behavior is
      highly dependent upon gonadal steroids, sexual behavior in a large
      proportion of these hybrid male mice after castration is independent of
      gonadal steroid hormones and their receptors; thus, we have the ability to
      discover novel genes involved in this behavior. Gene expression arrays,
      validation of gene candidates, and transgenic mice that overexpress one of
      the genes of interest were used to reveal genes involved in maintenance of
      male sexual behavior. Several genes related to neuroprotection and
      neurodegeneration were differentially expressed in the hypothalamus of
      males that continued to mate after castration. Male mice overexpressing
      the human form of one of these candidate genes, amyloid beta precursor
      protein (APP), displayed enhanced sexual behavior before castration and
      maintained sexual activity for a longer duration after castration compared
      with controls. Our results reveal a novel and unexpected relationship
      between APP and male sexual behavior. We speculate that declining APP
      during normal aging in males may contribute to the loss of sexual
      function.

TI  - Fat Infiltration of Muscle, Diabetes, and Clinical Fracture Risk in Older
      Adults.
AB  - Context: Older adults with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk for fracture
      compared with nondiabetic adults after adjustment for their higher bone
      mineral density. Infiltration of muscle by fat predicts increased risk of
      hip fracture. Objective: We investigated whether fat infiltration of
      muscle, which is greater in diabetic adults, is associated with all
      clinical fracture and whether it accounts for the increased fracture risk
      in those with diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data were
      analyzed from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, a cohort of
      community-dwelling adults aged 70-79 yr. Glucose metabolism status and
      x-ray attenuation of thigh muscle were determined at baseline for 2762
      participants. Main Outcome Measures: During a mean 8.2 +/- 2.3 yr
      follow-up, 331 participants reported at least one clinical fracture.
      Results: Fat infiltration of muscle was higher in those with diabetes or
      impaired glucose metabolism than in those with normal glucose metabolism
      (P &lt; 0.001). Fat infiltration of muscle was independently associated with
      a 19% increased risk of incident clinical fracture (multivariate hazard
      ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence interval = 1.04-1.36); this association did
      not differ across glucose metabolism groups (P for interaction = 0.65). As
      previously reported, diabetes was associated with a greater fracture risk
      compared with normal glucose metabolism (hazard ratio = 1.42; 95%
      confidence interval = 1.07-1.89) after adjustment for bone mineral
      density, but further adjustment for fat infiltration of muscle did not
      attenuate this association. Conclusions: Fat infiltration of muscle
      predicts clinical fracture in older adults. Although fat infiltration of
      muscle is higher among those with diabetes, it does not account for their
      increased fracture risk.

TI  - Triiodothyronine Promotes Cardiac Differentiation and Maturation of
      Embryonic Stem Cells via the Classical Genomic Pathway.
AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into functional
      cardiomyocytes and thus represent a promising cell source for cardiac
      regenerative therapy. Nevertheless, the therapeutic application of
      ESC-derived cardiomyocytes is limited by the low efficacy of the current
      protocol for cardiac differentiation and their immature phenotypes.
      Although thyroid hormone is essential for normal cardiac development and
      function, its role in the cardiac differentiation of ESCs, as well as the
      maturation of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes, remains unclear. In this study,
      we examined the cardiac differentiation of murine ESCs in the presence of
      T3 for 7 d using flow cytometry, RT-PCR, cellular electrophysiology study,
      and confocal calcium imaging. Compared with control conditions, T3
      supplementation increased the number of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes and was
      accompanied by up-regulation of a panel of cardiac markers, including
      Nkx2.5, myosin light chain-2V, as well as alpha- and beta-myosin heavy
      chain. More importantly, electrophysiological study revealed that
      ESC-derived cardiomyocytes exhibited more adult-like phenotypes after T3
      supplementation based on action potential characteristics. They also
      exhibited more adult-like calcium homeostasis properties. These phenotypic
      changes were associated with up-regulation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum
      calcium ATPase-2a and ryanodine receptor-2 expression. In addition, the
      classical (genomic) pathway was shown to be involved in T3-induced cardiac
      differentiation of ESCs. Our results show that T3 supplementation promotes
      cardiac differentiation of ESCs and enhances maturation of
      electrophysiological, as well as calcium homeostasis, properties of
      ESC-derived cardiomyocytes.

TI  - Aging of the innate immune system.
AB  - The innate immune system is composed of a network of cells including
      neutrophils, NK and NKT cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells
      that mediate the earliest interactions with pathogens. Age-associated
      defects are observed in the activation of all of these cell types, linked
      to compromised signal transduction pathways including the Toll-like
      Receptors. However, aging is also characterized by a constitutive
      pro-inflammatory environment (inflamm-aging) with persistent low-grade
      innate immune activation that may augment tissue damage caused by
      infections in elderly individuals. Thus, immunosenescence in the innate
      immune system appears to reflect dysregulation, rather than exclusively
      impaired function.

TI  - Mortality with Alzheimer's disease and dementia in France, 2006.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's and related diseases have become a major public
      health issue in all developed countries, particularly with the aging of
      the population. Given the potential burden of these pathologies, the
      French government launched a third National Alzheimer's Strategic Plan
      2008-2012 in 2008. The aim of the study was to provide French data on the
      mortality statistics of Alzheimer's and related diseases by age, gender,
      and geographical area. METHODS: Analyses were based on the number of
      deaths from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, extracted from the
      2000-2006 French National Mortality Registry (Inserm-Centre
      d'epidemiologie sur les causes medicales de deces [CepiDc]). Underlying
      and multiple causes of death were taken into account. Gender, age, area of
      residence, and place of death were noted for all subjects deceased with AD
      or dementia. Mortality rates were standardized on the truncated 60+ French
      2006 population. Mortality rates were also estimated by 5-year age groups.
      Causes of death in demented and nondemented people were compared by
      estimating an age-adjusted relative-risk ratio. RESULTS: In France, in
      2006, AD or dementia was reported as the underlying cause or a multiple
      cause of death on 45,597 death certificates. Among these death
      certificates, 70% were women and the mean age at death was 85.9 years.
      Age-standardized mortality rates were 341/100,000 person-years for men and
      333/100,000 person-years for women. Age-specific mortality rates increased
      with age and were higher in women than in men over 90 years of age. The
      analysis of the changes in mortality rates showed an overall increase of
      11.3% between 2000 and 2006. The most frequent underlying cause when AD or
      dementia was mentioned as an associated cause were cardiovascular diseases
      (40.5%), neoplasms (11.9%), and endocrine diseases (8.5%). CONCLUSION: The
      analysis of mortality data on AD and dementia provides insight into the
      burden of these diseases in France. If carried out regularly, these
      analyses can provide trend analyses of mortality rates.

TI  - Age and sex mediated changes in epicardial fat adipokines.
AB  - Aging, which is an independent risk factor for heart disease, alters body
      fat mass and its function. Epicardial fat plays an important physiological
      and pathophysiological role on cardiac structure and function. This study
      investigated if aging altered the abundance of epicardial (EF) and
      abdominal fat (AF) derived mediators in a sex dependent manner in female
      and male Fischer 344xBrown Norway hybrid (FBN) rats. EF and AF were
      obtained from 48 female and male, young (6 months), aged (26/30 months)
      and very aged (30/36 months) FBN rats. Adipose derived anti-inflammatory
      and pro-inflammatory mediators were measured using ELISA, adipokine array
      and real-time qPCR. No dramatic changes in circulating lipids other than a
      higher triglyceride and high density lipoprotein in aged females and a
      significantly increased circulating adiponectin (p&lt;0.005) in aged rats
      were observed. Real time PCR results showed that compared to 6 months old
      female rats, the aged (26 months) and very aged (30 months) rats had
      significantly lower levels of EF genes: adiponectin (p&lt;0.005), PPARgamma
      (p&lt;0.01, 0.005), IL-6 (p&lt;0.01) and PAI-1 (p&lt;0.01, 0.01), respectively, but
      not in AF. In contrast, the male rats exhibited an increase in IL-6 in EF
      (p&lt;0.005) but a decrease in adiponectin and PPARgamma in AF with aging.
      These changes might be attributed to differences in adipocyte make-up or
      macrophage infiltration. In conclusion, aging had a more profound impact
      on EF derived mediators in female rather than male rats, which might help
      explain the increased risk to cardiovascular disease seen in older women.

TI  - Longevity and lifespan control in mammals: lessons from the mouse.
AB  - Aging, which affects all organ systems, is one of the most complex
      phenotypes. Recent discoveries in long-lived mutant mice have revealed
      molecular mechanisms of longevity in mammals which may contribute to our
      understanding of why humans age. These mutations include
      naturally-occurring spontaneous mutations, and those of mice genetically
      modified by modern genomic technologies. It is generally believed that the
      most fundamental mechanisms of aging are evolutionarily conserved across
      species. The following types of longevity mechanisms have been intensively
      studied: suppression of the somatotropic (growth hormone/insulin-like
      growth factor 1) axis, decreased metabolism and increased resistance of
      oxidative stress, reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin
      sensitivity, and delayed reproductive maturation and reduced fertility. In
      addition, many of the mutations have a sex-dependent effect on lifespan,
      and when present in different genetic backgrounds, the effects of the same
      gene mutation can vary considerably. The present review discusses these
      phenotypic variations as well as describing the known longevity genes in
      long-lived mutant mice and the molecular mechanisms specifying longevity.
      We anticipate that these mouse studies will ultimately provide clues about
      how to delay the aging and prolong lifespan, and help to develop therapies
      for healthier human aging.

TI  - Aging Beijing: Challenges and Strategies of Health Care for the Elderly.
AB  - Following the global trend of population aging, China became an aging
      society at the end of the 20(th) century. The ever-growing medical demands
      of the elderly, the lag in medical insurance policy, and the late
      development of geriatric services make the present situation of public
      health in China worrying. To meet these challenges, the Beijing municipal
      government has actively adjusted its development strategies and has been
      building up a medical service and healthcare system suitable for the
      elderly. The core of the system is a three-level management of geriatric
      diseases: prevention and treatment for chronic diseases, functional
      rehabilitation, long-term care, and family attendance at rural and urban
      community health service centers (stations); post-acute rehabilitation,
      long-term care, and palliative treatment in the specialized geriatric
      hospitals of every district (county); and rescue and treatment for acute
      and serious geriatric diseases in the geriatric sections of all general
      hospitals and Beijing Geriatric Hospital. By raising awareness and gaining
      support from all of society, the implementation of this system will
      benefit millions of elderly people and promote the sustainable financial
      development and social harmony of Beijing.

TI  - Successful Physiological Aging and Episodic Memory: a Brain Stimulation
      Study.
AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that younger adults tend to
      asymmetrically recruit specific regions of an hemisphere in an episodic
      memory task (Hemispheric Encoding Retrieval Asymmetry - HERA model). In
      older adults, this hemispheric asymmetry is generally reduced as suggested
      by the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction for OLDer adults - HAROLD - model
      [3]. Recent works suggest that while low-performing older adults do not
      show this reduced asymmetry, high-performing older adults counteract
      age-related neural decline through a plastic reorganization of cerebral
      networks that results in reduced functional asymmetry. However, the issue
      of whether high- and low-performing older adults show different degrees of
      asymmetry and the relevance of this process for counteracting aging have
      not been clarified. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to
      transiently interfere with the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLPFC) during encoding or retrieval of associated and
      non-associated word pairs. A group of healthy older adults was studied
      during encoding and retrieval of word pairs. The subjects were divided in
      two subgroups according to their experimental performance (i.e., high- and
      low-performing). TMS effects on retrieval differed according to the
      subject's subgroup. In particular, the predominance of left vs. right
      DLPFC effects during encoding, predicted by the HERA model, was observed
      only in low-performing older adults, while the asymmetry reduction
      predicted by the HAROLD model was selectively shown for the
      high-performing group. The present data confirm that older adults with
      higher memory performance show less prefrontal asymmetry as an efficient
      strategy to counteract age-related memory decline.

TI  - Modeling the Cardiac Surgery Workforce in Canada.
PG  - 467-473
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited employment opportunities for recently trained cardiac
      surgeons are deterring medical students from entering cardiac surgery
      residency programs. Given the lengthy training period and the aging of
      both the general population and currently practicing cardiac surgeons,
      this reduced enrollment raises concerns about the adequacy of the future
      cardiac surgery workforce. A workforce model was developed to explore the
      future need for cardiac surgeons in Canada. METHODS: A novel system
      dynamics model was developed to simulate the supply and demand for cardiac
      surgery in Canada between 2008 and 2030 to identify whether an excess or
      shortage of surgeons would exist. Several different scenarios were
      examined, including varying surgeon productivity, revascularization rates,
      and residency enrollment rates. RESULTS: The simulation results of various
      scenarios are presented. In the base case, a surgeon shortage is expected
      to develop by 2025, although this depends on surgeons' response to
      demand-supply gap changes. An alternative scenario in which residency
      enrollment directly relates to the presence of unemployed surgeons also
      projects substantial shortages after 2021. The model results indicate that
      if residency enrollment rates remain at the 2009 level an alarming
      shortage may develop soon, possibly reaching almost 50% of the Canadian
      cardiac surgical workforce. CONCLUSIONS: These workforce model results
      project an eventual cardiac surgeon shortage in Canada. This study
      highlights the possibility of a crisis in cardiac surgery and emphasizes
      the urgency with which enrollment into cardiac surgery training programs
      and the employability of recently trained cardiac surgery graduates need
      to be addressed.

TI  - Geropsychology content in clinical training programs: a comparison of
      Australian, Canadian and U.S. data.
PG  - 909-18
AB  - ABSTRACTBackground: There is a worldwide shortage of mental health
      professionals trained in the provision of mental health services to older
      adults. This shortage in many countries is most acutely felt in the
      discipline of psychology. Examining training programs in clinical
      psychology with respect to training content may shed light on ways to
      increase interest among students and improve practical experiences in
      working with older adults.Methods: A large multinational survey of
      geropsychology content in university-based clinical and counselling
      psychology training programs was conducted in 2007 in the U.S.A.,
      Australia, and Canada. Both clinical/counseling programs and
      internship/practicum placements were surveyed as to staffing, didactic
      content and training opportunities with respect to geropsychology.Results:
      Survey response rates varied from 15% in the U.S.A. (n = 46), 70% in
      Australia (n = 25) to 91.5% in Canada (n = 22). The U.S.A. and Australia
      reported specialist concentrations in geropsychology within graduate
      clinical psychology training programs. More assessment and psychopathology
      courses in the three countries were cited as having ageing content than
      psychotherapy courses. Many non-specialist programs in all three countries
      offered course work in geropsychology, and many had staff who specialized
      in working clinically with an older population. Interest in expanding
      aging courses and placements was cited by several training sites.
      Recruiting staff and finding appropriate placement opportunities with
      older adult populations were cited as barriers to expanding geropsychology
      offerings.Conclusions: In light of our results, we conclude with a
      discussion of innovative means of engaging students with ageing
      content/populations, and suggestions for overcoming staffing and placement
      shortcomings.

TI  - Geropsychology and psychogeriatrics in Portugal: research, education and
      clinical training.
PG  - 854-63
AB  - ABSTRACTBackground: In response to the global challenges of population
      aging in Portugal, it is crucial to improve research, education and
      clinical training in old age in order to meet the growing demands placed
      on psychogeriatric care services.Methods: An overview is provided on the
      status of old age psychology and psychiatry as part of the
      multidisciplinary care delivery system for the elderly in Portugal.
      Available educational offerings and clinical training in geriatric mental
      health at both undergraduate and postgraduate level are described, as well
      as primary research associations and initiatives within Portugal.Results:
      Important issues raised include the need for more educational and clinical
      training programs for specialists, a broader commitment to aging research
      and the need to increase interest in working with older adults among
      students across disciplines. The recent movement towards multidisciplinary
      work conducted by researchers, psychiatrists, psychologist and other
      health professionals in Portugal points to the urgent need for specialist
      education for all health professionals working in geriatrics. This
      educational initiative must focus not only on the transmission of
      knowledge on aging-related topics, but also on the training of specific
      skills and competencies. Improving geriatric mental health service
      delivery and connecting research with clinical practice constitute other
      significant steps forward.Conclusions: An effective intervention in
      psychogeriatrics should involve a strategy with the participation of a
      multidimensional network that includes the commitment of researchers,
      educators, clinicians, health policy-makers and older adults. Several
      recommendations to improve late life mental health care are presented.

TI  - The evolving burden of HIV infection compared with other chronic diseases
      in northern Italy.
AB  - Objectives The aim of the study was to estimate the burden and direct
      costs of diseases in HIV-infected patients (either opportunistic illnesses
      or other chronic diseases) with respect to the HIV-uninfected population.
      These estimates will be useful for the projection of future direct costs
      of HIV care. Patients and methods A population-based study was conducted
      in the Brescia Local Health Agency in northern Italy. An administrative
      database recorded diagnoses, deaths, drug prescriptions and health
      resource utilization for all medical and surgical patients in the region
      from 2003 to 2007. The study estimated the prevalence of HIV infection as
      well as HIV-related mortality and annual cost per patient, and compared
      mortality and costs related to HIV infection with those for a set of 15
      other chronic diseases. The standardized hazard ratio (SHR) and
      standardized mortality ratio (SMR) were obtained using an indirect
      standardization method. Results The prevalence of HIV infection increased
      from 218 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2003 to 263 per 100 000 in 2007.
      Although mortality rates decreased markedly (from 24 per 1000 HIV-infected
      patients in 2003 to 16 per 1000 in 2007), the data show that mortality was
      still higher in HIV-infected patients compared with the general population
      in the most recent years (SMR 8.8 in 2007). In each year included in the
      study, HIV-infected patients had higher rates of care-seeking for chronic
      diseases, including liver diseases (SHR&gt;8), neuropathy,
      oesophagus-gastro-duodenum diseases, serious psychiatric disorders and
      renal failure (SHR approximately 3 for each). Also, the rate of medical
      attendance for neoplasias, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and
      cardiovascular disease increased over time in HIV-infected patients
      compared with the general population. Ranking diseases in order of their
      total cost to the health system, HIV infection ranked 12th, with total
      costs of euro28.6 million in 2007. Ranking in order of cost per patient,
      HIV infection ranked third, with a cost per patient of euro9894 in 2007.
      HIV-infected patients with concomitant chronic diseases had higher average
      costs. The cost per patient in 2007 was euro8104 for HIV-infected patients
      without other chronic diseases, euro9908 for HIV infection plus
      cardiovascular disease, euro11 370 for HIV infection plus chronic liver
      disease and euro12 013 for HIV infection plus neoplasias. Conclusions The
      prevalence and population cost of people living with HIV are likely to
      increase as a result of prolonged survival, aging of HIV-infected patients
      and increased risk of other chronic diseases. In the near future, HIV
      infection will rank as one of the most costly chronic diseases. Prevention
      strategies need to be more widely adopted to control the growing burden of
      the HIV epidemic and other chronic diseases affecting HIV-infected
      patients.

TI  - Differential proteomic analysis distinguishes tissue repair biomarker
      signatures in wound exudates obtained from normal healing and chronic
      wounds.
AB  - Chronic wounds associated with vascular disease, diabetes mellitus or
      aging are leading causes of morbidity in western countries and represent
      an unresolved clinical problem. The development of innovative strategies
      to promote tissue repair is therefore an important task that requires a
      more thorough analysis of the underlying molecular pathophysiology. We
      propose that the understanding of the complex biological events that
      control tissue repair or its failure largely benefits from a broad
      analytical approach as provided by novel proteomic methodologies. Here we
      present the first comparative proteome analysis of wound exudates obtained
      from normal healing or non-healing (venous leg ulcer) human skin wounds. A
      total of 149 proteins were identified with high confidence. A minority of
      proteins was exclusively present in exudate of the healing wound (23
      proteins) or the non-healing wound (26 proteins). Of particular interest
      was the differential distribution of specific proteins among the two
      different healing phenotypes. Whereas in the exudate obtained from the
      healing wound mediators characteristic for tissue formation were
      abundantly present, in the exudate obtained from the non-healing wound
      numerous mediators characteristic for a persistent inflammatory and tissue
      destructive response were identified. Furthermore, the study revealed also
      interesting results regarding the identification of new proteins with yet
      unknown functions in skin repair. This analysis therefore represents an
      important basis for the search for potential biomarkers, which give rise
      to a better understanding and monitoring of disease progression in chronic
      wounds.

      Nanospray-Desorption/Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (dagger).
AB  - Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) combined with
      high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) is a promising approach for the
      detailed, molecular-level chemical characterization of atmospheric organic
      aerosols (OA) collected in laboratory and field experiments. The nano-DESI
      technique possesses distinct advantages of technical simplicity, enhanced
      sensitivity, and signal stability. In nano-DESI, analyte is desorbed into
      a solvent bridge formed between two capillaries and the analysis surface,
      which enables fast and efficient characterization of OA collected on
      substrates without sample preparation. Stable signals achieved using
      nano-DESI make it possible to obtain high-quality HR-MS data both for
      laboratory-generated and field-collected OA using only a small amount of
      material (&lt;10 ng). Furthermore, nano-DESI enables the efficient detection
      of chemically labile compounds in OA, which is important for understanding
      chemical aging phenomena.

TI  - Carts in a time of transition. As multiple trends shape how clinicians do
      their work, CIOs ponder the future of mobile carts.
PG  - 26, 28-9
AB  - CIOs are actively trying to figure out how to plan for the mobile
      computing needs of their clinicians in the next several years. Though a
      broad range of viewpoints prevails across the healthcare system, most CIOs
      believe they will continue to rely heavily on mobile computing carts to
      meet clinicians' computing needs within their facilities, even in the face
      of the emergence of newer, tablet-sized computing devices. Clinician needs
      and preferences remain paramount considerations as CIOs move to replace
      sometimes-aging current fleets of computing carts.

TI  - Functional phenotyping of successful aging in long-term memory: Preserved
      performance in the absence of neural compensation.
AB  - We investigated whether preservation of encoding-related brain activity
      patterns in older age reflects successful aging in long-term memory. Using
      a statistical matching technique, we identified groups of healthy older
      adults with different degrees of Functional Activity Deviation during
      Encoding (FADE) from young adults in a memory network comprising
      hippocampal, temporal, occipital, and retrosplenial regions. High FADE
      scores were associated with impairment in recollection, abnormal activity
      in the default mode network, and lower gray matter density in bilateral
      ventral prefrontal cortex and left rhinal cortex; a constellation
      previously associated with increased risk for dementia. Low FADE scores
      functionally phenotyped successful aging because recollection was well
      preserved and there was no evidence for compensatory prefrontal
      activation. Thus, for some individuals successful aging in long-term
      memory reflects the preservation of a functionally specific memory
      network, and can occur in the absence of compensatory brain activity.

TI  - Inhibitory activity of alpha-tocoferol on apoptosis in the rat bladder
      wall subjected to androgen deprivation.
AB  - Alpha-tocopherol
      (2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-chromon-8-ol) is used in
      many previous urological studies. Thus to add to this knowledge in this
      study we studied the potential inhibitory activity on oxidative stress and
      process apoptosis on bladder wall in male rats subjected to androgen
      deprivation. A causal relationship between lower testosterone levels and
      apoptosis, as a component of castration-induced muscle atrophy, has been
      shown. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were used in this experiment, divided
      into four groups: control (sham operation; n = 10); castration (n = 10);
      castration, with alpha-tocopherol supplementation over preceding four
      weeks (n = 10); and castration, with alpha-tocopherol supplementation over
      preceding four weeks and subsequent eight weeks (n = 10). Activated
      caspase-3 was detected using a previously described technique, with
      analysis using stereological methodology. Nonparametric methods were used
      to test statistical significance, taking a significance level of P &lt;
      0.005. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the university
      where the project was developed. The serum testosterone concentrations
      before castration were less than 20 pg/ml. Analysis of 8-isoprostane
      showed statistical significance (P &lt; 0.0003). The volumetric density of
      caspase-3 showed significant differences between the groups. There was no
      statistical significance regarding caspase-3 between sham and
      alpha-tocopherol plus castration or between the groups that received
      alpha-tocopherol supplementation. The observations showed that there was
      greater apoptosis in the group with castration alone than in the groups
      with alpha-tocopherol supplementation. This finding, together with the
      induced androgen deprivation and higher 8-isoprostane levels, corroborates
      the hypothesis that alpha-tocopherol supplementation has an important
      protective effect under conditions of oxidative stress, thereby avoiding
      the apoptotic process, especially regarding aging. Neurourol. Urodyn. (c)

TI  - Chondrogenic potential of subpopulations of cells expressing mesenchymal
      stem cell markers derived from human synovial membranes.
AB  - In this study we analyzed the chondrogenic potential of subpopulations of
      MSCs derived from human synovial membranes enriched for CD73, CD106 and
      CD271 markers.Subpopulations of human synovial membrane MSCs enriched for
      CD73, CD106 and CD271 markers were isolated using a cytometry sorter and
      characterized by flow cytometry for MSC markers. The expression of Sox9,
      Nanog and Runx2 genes by these cells was measured by reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The chondrogenesis of each
      subpopulation was assessed by culturing the cells in a defined medium to
      produce spontaneous spheroid formation and differentiation towards
      chondrocyte-like cells. The examination of the spheroids by histological
      and immunohistochemical analyses for collagen type II (COL2), aggrecan,
      collagen type I (COL1), metalloprotease 13 (MMP13) and collagen type X
      (COLX) levels were performed to assess their chondrogenesis capacity. The
      adipogenesis and osteogenesis potential of each subpopulation was
      determined using commercial media; the resulting cells were stained with
      oil red O or red alizarin to test the degree of differentiation.The
      subpopulations had different profiles of cells positive for the MSC
      markers CD44, CD69, CD73, CD90 and CD105 and showed different expression
      levels of the genes Sox9, Nanog, Runx2 involved in chondrogenesis,
      undifferentiation and osteoblastogenesis, respectively.
      Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that COL1, COL2, COLX, MMP13 and
      aggrecan were expressed in the spheroids as soon as 14 days of culture.
      The CD271(+) subpopulation expressed the highest levels of COL2 staining
      compared to the other subpopulations. CD105 and Runx2 were shown by
      immunohistochemistry and genetic analysis to have significantly higher
      expression CD271+ subpopulation than the other subpopulations.Spheroids
      formed from CD271-enriched and CD73-enriched MSCs from normal human
      synovial membranes mimic the native cartilage extracellular matrix more
      closely than CD106(+) MSCs and are possible candidates for use in
      cartilage tissue engineering. Both cell types have potential for promoting
      the differentiation of MSCs into chondrocytes, presenting new
      possibilities for achieving intrinsic cartilage repair. (c) 2010

TI  - Colorectal carcinoma: an update of current trends in accra.
PG  - 178-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical experience and earlier studies indicate that the
      number of colorectal cancer cases seen annually in the Accra metropolis is
      increasing. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at providing a current update
      on colorectal cancer in Accra, Ghana. METHODS: A prospective study of
      confirmed cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed from January 1997- December
      2007. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine colorectal cancer cases were
      studied. Males were 192(53.5%) and females 167(46.5%) with an annual
      incidence of 32.6 new cases. The crude incidence rates were 12.53, 9.87
      and 11.18 per 100,000 population for males, females and overall
      respectively. Rectal bleeding 185(51.1%), abdominal mass 76(21.1%),
      intestinal obstruction 62(17.3%), intestinal perforation nine (2.5%) and
      iron deficiency anaemia nine (2.5%) cases were the main presentations.
      There were 168 (46.8%) rectal and 191(53.2%) colon tumours. Two hundred
      and thirty-one patients had laparotomy with 225 resections, and 128
      patients for various reasons did not undergo surgery. The Astler Coller
      stages of the tumours at diagnosis were C2 84(36.7%), C1 53(22.1%), B2
      49(21.4%), D 17(7.4%), B1 14(6.1%) and A 12(5.1%) cases. Adenocarcinoma
      was the commonest histological type 321(89.4%), with the majority either
      well-differentiated (62.5%) or moderately well-differentiated (25.6)
      carcinomas. Poorly differentiated carcinomas accounted for 28 cases
      (7.8%). Post-operative mortality was 6.1%. Long term survival could not be
      assessed as the majority of patients were lost to follow up. CONCLUSION:
      The incidence of colorectal cancer has increased over the last four
      decades in tandem with an aging population of Accra with adenocarcinoma as
      the predominant histological type.

TI  - Economic Analysis of "Liquid" versus Surgical Face-lift: Are Large-Volume
      Facial Soft Tissue Filler Injection Treatments a Viable Alternative to
      Rhytidectomy?
PG  - 296-302
AB  - For many years, rhytidectomy has been the mainstay of facial rejuvenative
      treatment, and continued improvement of our understanding of the anatomy,
      aesthetics, and aging of the face has allowed the development of safer,
      longer lasting, and more natural surgical techniques. However, the
      renaissance of soft tissue augmentation that began at the start of the new
      millennium now offers office-based rejuvenative procedures that have been
      touted as equivalent to traditional surgical procedures, including the
      "injectable rhinoplasty" and, more commonly, the "injectable face-lift."
      Although injectable filler treatments cannot exactly simulate the benefits
      of surgical rhytidectomy, they can significantly rejuvenate the face and
      obviate or delay the need for surgery. These are touted as simpler as well
      as easier and cheaper for the patient. But are they? No cost-effectiveness
      study of these "filler face-lifts" has ever been published, and the need
      for repeat treatments suggests that at some point in time, patient costs
      for these procedures may exceed those for a single surgical procedure.
      This study examines common scenarios for large-volume soft tissue filler
      facial rejuvenation and compares the costs of these treatments with those
      of traditional face-lift surgery.

TI  - Value-Based Purchasing Paradigms for Facial Plastic Surgery.
PG  - 283-288
AB  - The United States spends more per capita for health care than any other
      nation in the world. Unfortunately, this expenditure has not necessarily
      translated into improved patient outcomes. Technological advances coupled
      with an aging population have contributed to a steady increase in health
      care spending, projected to have reached $2.5 trillion in 2009. Until
      recently, facial plastic surgeons have not given attention to value-based
      purchasing and pay-for-performance paradigms, perceiving these quality
      agendas as primarily applicable to primary care physicians and chronic
      disease management. As the use of quality measure factors in physician
      reimbursement schemes for primary medical care becomes more prevalent, it
      is imperative that surgical specialists have better insight and knowledge
      of these trends and their impact. This review will define quality and
      outcomes parameters in conjunction with an analysis of how outcomes may,
      in the future, be attached to reimbursement for facial plastic surgeons.
      Illustration of common facial plastic surgery procedures and potential
      quality/outcome/performance schema will highlight key elements to assist
      these surgeons in preparing for the transformation of the health care
      system to quality and outcomes metrics.

TI  - Correlates and phenomenology of first and third person memories.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - The present research addressed fundamental questions about the visual
      perspective of autobiographical memories: Are stable personality
      characteristics associated with visual perspective? Does visual
      perspective influence the memory's phenomenological qualities?
      Participants in Study 1 (N=1684) completed individual-difference measures
      and indicated the perspective from which they generally retrieve memories.
      Participants in Study 2 (N=706) retrieved a memory from their natural or
      manipulated perspective, rated its phenomenology, and completed the same
      individual-difference measures. Dissociation and anxiety were associated
      with third person retrieval style; the Big Five personality traits were
      primarily unrelated to perspective. Compared to third person memories,
      naturally occurring first person memories were higher on Vividness,
      Coherence, Accessibility, Sensory Detail, Emotional Intensity, and Time
      Perspective, and lower on Distancing; manipulating perspective eliminated
      these differences. Visual perspective is associated with clinically
      relevant constructs and, although associated with the memory's
      phenomenology, perspective does not shape it.

TI  - Erectile Dysfunction as a Complication of Heart Failure.
AB  - Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an increasingly common problem in the aging
      population and has been associated with chronic heart failure (HF), either
      as an epiphenomenon or even as an early marker for underlying
      cardiovascular disease. ED has a significant effect on patients' quality
      of life. This chapter reviews ED in patients with HF and prevention and
      treatment based on current data from the literature. Causes include
      physiologic changes resulting in decreased cardiac function and exercise
      capacity, intrinsic vascular and neurohormonal abnormalities, and
      extrinsic factors such as medication side effects and psychological
      issues. Physicians should address these issues with patients and begin
      treatment by optimizing HF management and minimizing medications with ED
      side effects. Use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors provides significant
      improvement of ED and quality of life. Further research still is needed
      regarding long-term effects of ED treatment, investigation of newer
      medications, and preventive measures in this patient population.

TI  - Antibacterial effects of brand-name teicoplanin and generic products
      against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Glycopeptide antibiotics, such as vancomycin and teicoplanin, have been
      used worldwide to treat infection caused by methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Generic teicoplanin products were
      manufactured by many companies in 2009. We investigated the susceptibility
      of 147 MRSA strains to brand-name teicoplanin (TEIC-1) and seven generic
      products (TEIC-2 to TEIC-8). The MIC(90) of generic TEIC-5 and TEIC-7 was
      8 mug/ml whereas that of TEIC-1 and other generic products was 4 mug/ml.
      The potency equivalent of generic TEIC-5 and TEIC-7 was lower than that of
      TEIC-1, and TEIC content (%) per potency equivalent (200 mg) in a vial of
      these two generic products varied greatly compared with the other
      products. Although the potency equivalent of the TEIC used in this study
      was within the range stipulated in the Japanese Pharmacopeia, these
      results showed that the potency equivalent and susceptibility of two of
      the seven generic products differed from that of TEIC-1. The predicted
      AUC(0-72) value of those two generic products was 84-85% in comparison
      with that of TEIC-1. Among generic drugs, there may be products whose
      antimicrobial effect is not equal to that of the brand teicoplanin.

TI  - Histopathological lesions in different types of skin aging.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - Objective: Determination of histopathological changes in different types
      of skin aging. Methods and Results: The study included a group of 60 women
      with various types of skin aging. Three groups were distinguished, each
      group containing 20 individuals. Group I consisted of women with
      menopausal skin aging, Group II with photoaging, and Group III with
      chronological aging. Biopsy specimens were taken from the preauricular
      region for morphological examination. Signs of elastosis, inflammatory
      infiltrations, and collagenization were assessed. Elastosis was most often
      observed in Group II (in 80% of cases). Inflammatory infiltrations were
      observed in Group II in 75%, in Group III in 60%, and in Group I in 55% of
      patients. The largest collagenization lesions were found in photoaging.
      This phenomenon was observed in 90% of the women. Collagenization occurred
      in 55% of women in Groups I and III. Conclusions: The morphological
      picture of photoaging is typical and consists of collagenization
      occurrence in the corium, more pronounced elastosis, and the presence of
      inflammatory infiltrations. There are no characteristic morphological
      differences between chronological and menopausal aging, in which lesions
      occur to a considerably lesser degree.

TI  - Association between Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Vascular Risk Factors
      in Aging Men: The Hallym Aging Study.
PG  - 477-82
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between
      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and risk factors for vascular diseases
      in a population-based cohort study, the Hallym Aging Study (HAS).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among the 1,520 participants in HAS, 280 men aged
      more than 50 years, who underwent detailed health evaluations, including
      health-related questionnaires, evaluations of their medical history, and
      various life style factors, as well as clinical measurements, were
      included in the study. Vascular risk factors used in the present study
      including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking and
      were assessed by medical history and clinical measurements. LUTS were
      assessed by validated questionnaires, the International Prostate Symptom
      Score (IPSS), and the relationship between LUTS and vascular risk factors
      was investigated. RESULTS: Of the 280 men, 175 (62.5%) had moderate/severe
      LUTS (IPSS&gt;7) and 260 (93%) had one or more vascular risk factors. The
      IPSS was similar in those with no (11.6+/-9.7) and one or two (11.5+/-8.5)
      vascular risk factors, but increased to 15.1+/-9.3 in those with 3 or more
      vascular risk factors (p&lt;0.05). The multiple logistic regression analysis,
      controlling for age and body mass index (BMI) showed that men with 3 or
      more vascular risk factors were 3 times more likely to have
      moderate/severe LUTS than men without vascular risk factors (p&lt;0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Men with risk factors for vascular diseases are more likely
      to have LUTS and these findings suggest that vascular risk factors play a
      role in the development of LUTS.

TI  - Imaging upregulated brain arachidonic acid metabolism in HIV-1 transgenic
      rats.
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated infection involves the entry
      of virus-bearing monocytes into the brain, followed by microglial
      activation, neuroinflammation, and upregulated arachidonic acid (AA)
      metabolism. The HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat, a noninfectious HIV-1 model,
      shows neurologic and behavioral abnormalities after 5 months of age. We
      hypothesized that brain AA metabolism would be elevated in older HIV-1 Tg
      rats in vivo. Arachidonic acid incorporation from the plasma into the
      brain of unanesthetized 7-to-9-month-old rats was imaged using
      quantitative autoradiography, after [1-(14)C]AA infusion. Brain
      phospholipase (PLA(2)) activities and eicosanoid concentrations were
      measured, and enzymes were localized by immunostaining. AA incorporation
      coefficients k(*) and rates J(in), measures of AA metabolism, were
      significantly higher in 69 of 81 brain regions in HIV-1 Tg than in control
      rats, as were activities of cytosolic (c)PLA(2)-IV, secretory (s)PLA(2),
      and calcium independent (i)PLA(2)-VI, as well as prostaglandin E(2) and
      leukotriene B(4) concentrations. Immunostaining of somatosensory cortex
      showed elevated cPLA(2)-IV, sPLA(2)-IIA, and cyclooxygenase-2 in neurons.
      Brain AA incorporation and other markers of AA metabolism are upregulated
      in HIV-1 Tg rats, in which neurologic changes and neuroinflammation have
      been reported. Positron emission tomography with [1-(11)C]AA could be used
      to test whether brain AA metabolism is upregulated in HIV-1-infected
      patients, in relation to cognitive and behavioral disturbances.Journal of
      Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 28 July

TI  - Airborne Particle Exposure and Extrinsic Skin Aging.
AB  - For decades, extrinsic skin aging has been known to result from chronic
      exposure to solar radiation and, more recently, to tobacco smoke. In this
      study, we have assessed the influence of air pollution on skin aging in
      400 Caucasian women aged 70-80 years. Skin aging was clinically assessed
      by means of SCINEXA (score of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging), a
      validated skin aging score. Traffic-related exposure at the place of
      residence was determined by traffic particle emissions and by estimation
      of soot in fine dust. Exposure to background particle concentration was
      determined by measurements of ambient particles at fixed monitoring sites.
      The impact of air pollution on skin aging was analyzed by linear and
      logistic regression and adjusted for potential confounding variables. Air
      pollution exposure was significantly correlated to extrinsic skin aging
      signs, in particular to pigment spots and less pronounced to wrinkles. An
      increase in soot (per 0.5 x 10(-5) per m) and particles from traffic (per
      475 kg per year and square km) was associated with 20% more pigment spots
      on forehead and cheeks. Background particle pollution, which was measured
      in low residential areas of the cities without busy traffic and therefore
      is not directly attributable to traffic but rather to other sources of
      particles, was also positively correlated to pigment spots on face. These
      results indicate that particle pollution might influence skin aging as
      well.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication, 22

TI  - Effects of Hydraulic-Resistance Exercise on Strength and Power in
      Untrained Healthy Older Adults.
AB  - Lee, S, Islam, MM, Rogers, ME, Kusunoki, M, Okada, A, and Takeshima, N.
      Effects of hydraulic-resistance exercise on strength and power in
      untrained healthy older adults. J Strength Cond Res 24(x): 000-000,
      2010-The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of
      hydraulic-resistance exercise (HDRE) in improving strength and power in
      healthy older adults. Thirty-nine older adults (68.6 +/- 4.9 years; 15
      men, 24 women) were divided into a training group or control group (CON).
      Hydraulic-resistance exercise consisted of a 12-week supervised program,
      50 min.d, 3 d.wk. Hydraulic-resistance exercise was used for 10 exercises:
      Chest press and pull, shoulder press and pull, low back flexion and
      extension squat, leg adduction/abduction, leg press, and elbow
      extension/flexion. The number of the sets and the hydraulic-resistance
      dial setting (D) were gradually increased in 3 stages during the 12-week
      program. Strength, rating of perceived exertion, and relative intensity
      during exercise increased significantly from stage to stage whereas
      repetition velocity decreased. Total work was higher in the second stage
      compared with the first but lower in the final stage because of reduced
      repetitions. Peak torque at D2 and D11 increased (p &lt; 0.05) for knee
      extension (58 and 9%) and flexion (94 and 21%), chest press (35 and 12%)
      and pull (29 and 14%), shoulder press (14 and 18%) and pull (75 and 18%),
      and low back flexion (59 and 46%) and extension (84 and 34%). Peak power
      at D2 and D11 also increased (p &lt; 0.05) for knee extension (140 and 26%)
      and flexion (96 and 36%), chest press (54 and 28%) and pull (62 and 23%),
      shoulder press (55 and 31%) and pull (159 and 30%), and low back flexion
      (177 and 127%) and extension (104 and 66%). There were no significant
      changes in the CON. Hydraulic-resistance exercise elicits significant
      improvements in strength and power in older adults. Therefore, HDRE is an
      effective form of resistance training that provides benefits using low and
      moderate intensity of training for older adults.

TI  - Is Stroke History Reliably Reported by Elderly with Cognitive Impairment?
      A Community-Based Study.
PG  - 215-220
AB  - Background/Aims: Self-reported history of stroke has been questioned in
      the elderly due to the high prevalence of cognitive impairment. We tested
      the validity of response to a stroke questionnaire versus clinical
      diagnosis of stroke among elderly people with and without cognitive
      impairment. Methods: Community-dwelling participants to the phase 1
      Canadian Study of Health and Aging were screened for self-reported stroke.
      Physician-diagnosed stroke was set as the gold standard. The positive
      predictive value (PPV), sensitivity and specificity were determined.
      Results: 1,536/ 1,659 (93%) participants aged 65 years and over had stroke
      information from both sources. Among stroke positive responders, the PPV
      was 81% overall: 76% for cognitively normal, 84% for cognitively
      impairment with no dementia (CIND), and 82% for demented. Among stroke
      diagnosed by physicians, history of stroke was reported by 38% cognitively
      normal, 54% CIND, and 55% demented. The specificity was over 97% in all
      cognitive categories. Conclusion: Among community-dwelling elderly people,
      any cognitive impairment did not imply inaccurate self-reported history of
      stroke. High prevalence of stroke and frequent contacts with health
      services among cognitively-impaired elderly may increase the awareness of
      stroke symptoms and signs. Stroke increases the risk of developing
      dementia in both cognitively normal and CIND, and efforts to accomplish
      stroke prevention are justified, especially in these categories.

TI  - Global Evolutionary Trend of the Prevalence of Primary Glomerulonephritis
      over the Past Three Decades.
PG  - c337-c346
AB  - Objective: The prevalence of primary glomerulonephritis in Singapore is
      compared with that of 28 other countries to review changing trends in the
      evolution of primary glomerulonephritis in Asia and other countries.
      Method: 2,586 renal biopsies in Singapore over the past 3 decades were
      reviewed and compared with data from 28 other countries. Results: In the
      1st decade most Asian countries have mesangial proliferative
      glomerulonephritis as the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis,
      and in the 3rd decade there has been a dramatic increase in focal and
      segmental glomerulosclerosis reflecting aging and obesity in keeping with
      more developed countries. IgA nephritis remains the commonest
      glomerulonephritis in many countries. Membranous glomerulonephritis
      continues to be more prevalent in Western countries while mesangial
      proliferative glomerulonephritis remains prevalent in many Asian
      countries. Conclusion: Apart from geographical and genetic influences,
      socioeconomic factors may play a role in the evolution of the biopsy
      pattern in some countries. Worldwide, the prevalence of focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis continues to increase. In third world countries some of
      the commoner forms of glomerulonephritis are related to infections, in
      contrast to developed countries where the antigenic exposure may be
      related to diet, allergens and other industrial agents.

TI  - Bioethics and Innovation in Pediatric Nutrition Research.
PG  - 173-189
AB  - Advances in technology and understanding of fundamental human biology
      allow for an increasingly innovative research agenda in pediatric
      nutrition. All human research is governed by the norms of bioethics, which
      are in turn based on four primary principles: free will in participation,
      freedom from harm, opportunity to benefit, and non-discrimination in
      access. Legally, if not essentially, juveniles do not have free will to
      affirm their participation as research subjects. They have an absolute
      right, in nontherapeutic research, however, to decline. Pivotal in the
      discussion in nonthera-peutic research in healthy children is the
      tolerance for risky procedures. Complicated situations include:
      multi-national protocols, choice of developing country sites, the
      inclusion of placebo treatment arms, analysis of genetic biomarkers, and
      research for commercial enterprises. The overly stringent interpretation
      of bioethical principles, as adapted to children, would stifle innovation
      in research. A relaxed bioethical attitude in pursuit of advancing
      science, by contrast, could violate essential human rights and expose a
      population worthy of special protection to undue risk and harm. By
      following the course of utility, seeking the steepest benefit-to-risk
      ratios, weighted toward safety and child welfare, the divergent nature of
      the considerations should be brought into convergence for the sake of
      continuing innovation.

TI  - Desmin and troponin T are degraded faster in type IIb muscle fibers than
      in type I fibers during postmortem aging of porcine muscle.
AB  - A novel approach was applied in this study to directly evaluate the effect
      of muscle fiber type on postmortem protein degradation. Porcine muscle
      fibers were isolated from longissimus muscle at day 1, 3, and 6
      postmortem. Fibers were sorted by immunochemical myosin heavy chain
      isoform typing. Western blot analysis of fibers pooled separately into
      type I or IIb showed that the relative amounts of 39- and 50-kDa desmin
      degradation fragments at day 6, and 28- to 31-kDa fragments of troponin T
      fast type isoform (fTnT) at day 1 and 6 postmortem were higher in type IIb
      than in type I fibers. At day 6 troponin T slow type isoform (sTnT) was
      less degraded than fTnT in type I fibers. These results indicated greater
      rate and extent of proteolysis in type IIb than in type I fibers and
      higher susceptibility of fTnT to proteolysis than that of sTnT isoform.

TI  - Cellular stress from excitatory neurotransmission contributes to
      cholesterol loss in hippocampal neurons aging in vitro.
AB  - After approximately 3 weeks in vitro, hippocampal neurons present many of
      the typical hallmarks accompanying neuronal aging in vivo, including
      accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipofuscin granules,
      heterochromatic foci, and activation of the Jun N-terminal protein kinase
      (pJNK) and p53/p21 pathways. In addition, hippocampal neurons in vitro
      undergo a gradual loss of cholesterol, which is important for the
      activation of the prosurvival tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB. Here, we used
      the hippocampal in vitro system to investigate the possible cause of
      age-accompanying cholesterol loss. We report that cholesterol loss during
      in vitro aging is paralleled by upregulation and translocation to the
      neuronal surface of cholesterol-24-hydroxylase (Cyp46), the enzyme
      responsible for cholesterol removal from neurons. Chronic reduction of
      electrical activity diminished cholesterol loss in aged neurons and
      precluded the upregulation of cholesterol-24-hydroxylase. In agreement
      with a cause-effect relationship, stimulation of excitatory
      neurotransmission in young neurons led to cholesterol loss.
      Mechanistically, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated excitatory
      neurotransmission leads to cholesterol loss through generation of reactive
      oxygen species derived from the activation of the stress-responsive enzyme
      NADPH oxidase. Supporting the relevance of the in vitro data, reduced
      cholesterol was also detected in synaptic membranes from old mice brains.
      Furthermore, excitatory neurotransmission via the nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase pathway induced cholesterol loss in
      purified brain synaptosomes. The current studies highlight excitatory
      neurotransmission as 1 of the mechanisms involved in cholesterol loss
      during aging.

TI  - White matter fractional anisotropy is related to processing speed in
      metabolic syndrome patients: a case-control study.
PG  - 64
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Metabolic Syndrome (MetSd) is a cluster of vascular
      risk factors that may influence cerebrovascular pathology during aging.
      Recently, microstructural white matter (WM) changes detected by diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI) and processing speed deficits have been reported in
      MetSd patients. We aimed to test the relationship between WM alteration
      and cognitive impairment in these patients. METHODS: The sample comprised
      38 subjects (19 patients aged between 50 and 80 years old, and 19
      controls). All patients fulfilled National Cholesterol Education Program
      Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP-III) criteria for MetSd. Speed of
      information processing was measured by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test
      (SDMT) and reaction time (RT) on the Continuous Performance Test (CPT-II)
      and the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). DTI images were acquired in a 3 Tesla
      Siemens Trio scanner. Voxelwise statistical analysis of the fractional
      anisotropy (FA) data was performed using the Tract-Based Spatial
      Statistics part of the FMRIB Software Library. A correlation analysis was
      performed between processing speed variables and FA values. RESULTS: There
      was a larger proportion of slow subjects (percentile below 25th) in the
      patient group (Chi2= 7.125 p=0.008). FA values correlated positively with
      SDMT in anterior and posterior parts of the corpus callosum, and RT CPT-II
      correlated negatively with FA values in the anterior corpus callosum (p&lt;
      0.05 corrected) in the patient group. CONCLUSION: We found significant
      correlations between WM alterations and cognitive impairment in MetSd
      patients, especially in the frontal lobe. These findings highlight the
      importance of MetSd prevention and control due to its association with
      structural and functional damage in the central nervous system.

TI  - Effects of aerobic and strength-based training on metabolic health
      indicators in older adults.
PG  - 76
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The weakening of the cardiovascular system
      associated with aging could be countered by increasing levels of physical
      activity and functional fitness. However, inconsistent findings have been
      found, and the variety of characteristics of exercise used in previous
      studies may partly explain that inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: To
      investigate the training effect of sixteen weeks of moderate intensity,
      progressive aerobic and strength-based training on metabolic health of
      older women and men. METHODS: Sixty three sedentary individuals (mean (SD)
      age 76 (8) years) were randomly assigned to control (n = 31) or exercising
      (n = 32) groups. The training group was separated to aerobic (n = 18) or
      strength-based (n = 14). Training took place three times a week. Subjects
      agreed not to change their diet or lifestyle over the experimental period.
      RESULTS: Exercising group attained after treatment significant differences
      on body weight, waist circumference, body mass index, diastolic blood
      pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol relationship, high
      sensitivity C-reactive protein, and 6-minute walk distance. The control
      group only had significant differences on waist circumference. CONCLUSION:
      The training programs produced significant benefits on metabolic health
      indicators of sedentary older women and men.

TI  - Expression and functional profiling of neprilysin, insulin degrading
      enzyme and endothelin converting enzyme in prospectively studied elderly
      and Alzheimer's brain.
AB  - Abstract The brain steady state level of Abeta is determined by the
      balance between its production and removal, the latter through egress
      across blood and CSF barriers as well as Abeta degradation. The major
      Abeta degrading enzymes are neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme
      (IDE) and endothelin converting enzyme (ECE-1). Although evidence suggests
      that NEP is down-regulated in AD, the role of IDE and ECE in the Abeta
      accumulation in aging and dementia remains less certain. In this study, we
      examined mRNA and protein expression, as well as biological activity of
      NEP, IDE and ECE-1 in human frontal cortex by real-time RT-PCR for mRNA,
      immunoblotting for protein and highly sensitive and specific fluorescence
      assays for activity. The relationships between Abeta degrading enzymes and
      pathologic measures and clinical features were also assessed. The results
      showed that NEP mRNA, protein level and activity were decreased in AD
      compared with normal controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI). In
      contrast IDE activity was unchanged, but there was higher expression of
      IDE mRNA, indicating a possible compensatory reaction due to deficits in
      activity. ECE-1 expression in AD brain showed no significant difference
      compared to age-matched controls. Correlation analyses suggested that NEP
      expression was correlated with Abeta accumulation and clinical diagnosis,
      being lower in AD than in NCI. In contrast, neither IDE nor ECE-1
      correlated with Abeta or clinical diagnosis. These findings provide
      additional support for NEP as the major protease involved in Abeta
      degradation and suggest its possible therapeutic targeting in AD.

TI  - Targeting and Managing Behavioral Symptoms in Individuals with Dementia: A
      Randomized Trial of a Nonpharmacological Intervention.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the effects of an intervention that helps families
      manage distressing behaviors in family members with dementia. DESIGN:
      Two-group randomized trial. SETTING: In home. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred
      seventy-two caregivers and people with dementia. INTERVENTION: Up to 11
      home and telephone contacts over 16 weeks by health professionals who
      identified potential triggers of patient behaviors, including
      communication and environmental factors and patient undiagnosed medical
      conditions (by obtaining blood and urine samples) and trained caregivers
      in strategies to modify triggers and reduce their upset. Between 16 and 24
      weeks, three telephone contacts reinforced strategy use. MEASUREMENTS:
      Primary outcomes were frequency of targeted problem behavior and caregiver
      upset with and confidence managing it at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were
      caregiver well-being and management skills at 16 and 24 weeks and
      caregiver perceived benefits. Prevalence of medical conditions for
      intervention patients were also examined. RESULTS: At 16 weeks, 67.5% of
      intervention caregivers reported improvement in targeted problem behavior,
      compared with 45.8% of caregivers in a no-treatment control group
      (P=.002), and reduced upset with (P=.03) and enhanced confidence managing
      (P=.01) the behavior. Additionally, intervention caregivers reported less
      upset with all problem behaviors (P=.001), less negative communication
      (P=.02), less burden (P=.05), and better well-being (P=.001) than
      controls. Fewer intervention caregivers had depressive symptoms (53.0%)
      than control group caregivers (67.8%, P=.02). Similar caregiver outcomes
      occurred at 24 weeks. Intervention caregivers perceived more study
      benefits (P&lt;.05), including ability to keep family members home, than
      controls. Blood and urine samples of intervention patients with dementia
      showed that 40 (34.1%) had undiagnosed illnesses requiring physician
      follow-up. CONCLUSION: Targeting behaviors upsetting to caregivers and
      modifying potential triggers improves symptomatology in people with
      dementia and caregiver well-being and skills.

TI  - Community and Individual Race/Ethnicity and Home Health Care Use among
      Elderly Persons in the United States.
AB  - Objective. To investigate whether the interaction between individual
      race/ethnicity and community racial/ethnic composition is associated with
      health-related home care use among elderly persons in the United States.
      Data Sources. A nationally representative sample of community-dwelling
      elders aged 65+ from the 2000 to 2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
      (N=23,792) linked to block group-level racial/ethnic information from the
      2000 Decennial Census. Design. We estimated the likelihood of informal and
      formal home health care use for four racial/ethnic elderly groups
      (non-Hispanic [NH] whites, NH-blacks, NH-Asians, and Hispanics) living in
      communities with different racial/ethnic compositions. Principal Findings.
      NH-Asian and Hispanic elders living in block groups with &gt;/=25 percent of
      residents being NH-Asian or Hispanic, respectively, were more likely to
      use informal home health care than their counterparts in other block
      groups. No such effect was apparent for formal home health care.
      Conclusions. NH-Asian and Hispanic elders are more likely to use informal
      home care if they live in communities with a higher proportion of
      residents who share their race/ethnicity. A better understanding of how
      informal care is provided in different communities may inform policy
      makers concerned with promoting informal home care, supporting informal
      caregivers, or providing formal home care as a substitute or supplement to
      informal care.

      test. After the bond test, fractured surfaces were examined by scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, interfacial observation of silver
      nanoleakage was performed using the backscatter electron mode of SEM. The
      bond strengths of four of the six adhesive systems tested decreased
      significantly after 10 yr. However, no significant bond-strength reduction
      was recorded for the other two systems. The interfacial observations
      showed water tree propagation in the bonding resin layer as a typical
      morphological change after aging for five of the six adhesives tested.
      Water tree propagation may be a symptom of degradation in the resin
      bonding layer of resin-dentin bonds.

TI  - Actions of cathepsins on troponin T during postmortem aging of porcine
      muscle.
PG  - 501-5
AB  - In this study, we examined the contribution of the cathepsins (cathepsin D
      and crude cathepsins containing cathepsins B and L) to troponin T
      degradation during postmortem aging. The action of cathepsin D on troponin
      T was examined at various pHs (pH 4.0-6.5). The degradation of intact
      troponin T was observed at pH 4.0, but not observed at pH 5.5 and 6.5. As
      a result of the degradation of troponin T, the 30 kDa fragment was not
      generated in any pH condition. The action of the crude cathepsins on
      troponin T was also examined at various pHs (pH 4.0-6.5). The intact
      troponin T was degraded at pH 4.0 and the 30 kDa fragments were observed.
      These 30 kDa fragments disappeared during further incubation. On the other
      hand, at pH 5.5 and 6.5, the intact troponin T was degraded and the 30 kDa
      fragment was accumulated. These results suggested that the cathepsin D
      scarcely contributed to the degradation of troponin T during postmortem
      aging, but crude cathepsins containing cathepsins B and L were partially
      involved in the degradation of troponin T and the generation of 30 kDa
      fragments.

TI  - Irreversible Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency in Alcoholic Rats Without
      Chronic Pancreatitis After Alcohol Withdrawal.
AB  - Background: Long-term alcohol consumption alone did not cause chronic
      pancreatitis (CP) but impaired exocrine pancreatic function. This study is
      to explore the reversibility of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in the
      abstinent rats and its mechanism. Methods: Forty-eight healthy male Wistar
      rats were divided randomly into 4 groups: 6-month control, 6-month
      ethanol, 9-month control, and 9-month ethanol + withdrawal. Morphological
      changes of pancreatic acinar cells were observed. Pancreatic amylase and
      lipase were measured using an automatic biochemical analyzer. Free fatty
      acid (FFA) in rat intestinal chyme was measured. Cholecystokinin (CCK)
      levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. The expression of CCK-A
      receptors was quantitatively analyzed by Western blot. Results:
      Alcohol-induced ultramicrostructure changes of pancreatic acinar cells,
      including lipid droplets, myelinoid inclusion bodies, dilated rough
      endoplasmic reticulums, and diminished zymogen granules, were not
      attenuated after alcohol abstinence. The outputs of amylase and lipase,
      FFA content in intestinal chyme, and the intestinal and the pancreatic CCK
      levels in rats were reduced after chronic alcohol intake and were still
      lower than the control after cessation of alcohol use. Chronic ethanol
      intake or abstinence did not induce any change in the expression of CCK-A
      receptors. Conclusions: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was irreversible
      in alcoholic rats without CP after alcohol withdrawal. It may be
      attributed to reduced pancreatic CCK, long-standing fatty infiltration,
      ultramicrostructure injuries in pancreatic acinar cells, and aging.

TI  - Nonlinear Stimulation and Hormesis in Human Aging: Practical Examples and
      Action Mechanisms.
AB  - Abstract The process of aging is accompanied by a progressive reduction of
      biological dynamical sophistication, resulting in an increased probability
      of dysfunction, illness, and death. This loss of sophistication is
      inherent in all aging organisms. However, it may be possible to retard the
      rate of loss of biological complexity by introducing an increased amount
      of nonlinear, nonmonotonic external stimulation that challenges the
      organism and forces it to upregulate its biological processes. This can be
      achieved by exploiting the multiple effects of hormesis, through a wide
      range of challenges including physical, mental, and biological stress.
      Hormesis is widely encountered in biological systems, and its effects are
      also seen in humans. It is possible to use hormetic strategies (both
      conditioning hormesis and postexposure conditioning hormesis) to enhance
      the function of repair processes in aging humans and therefore prevent
      age-related chronic degenerative diseases and prolong healthy lifespan.
      Such techniques include dietary restriction and calorie restriction
      mimetics, intermittent fasting, environmental enrichment, cognitive and
      sense stimulation, sexuality-enhancing strategies, exposure to low or to
      high temperatures, and other physicochemical challenges. Current research
      supports the general principle that any type of a hormetic dose-response
      phenomenon has an effect that does not depend on the type of stressor and
      that it can affect any biological model. Therefore, novel types of
      innovative, mild, repeated stress or stimulation that challenge a
      biological system in a dose-response manner are likely to have an effect
      that, properly harnessed, can be used to delay, prevent, or reverse
      age-related changes in humans.

TI  - Rathke cleft cyst in seven-year-old girl presenting with central diabetes
      insipidus and review of literature.
PG  - 525-9
AB  - Rathke cleft cysts (RCC) are benign cysts derived from remnants of Rathke
      cleft, and are rarely symptomatic in children. Symptoms due to RCC are
      associated with mass effect and pituitary hormone deficiencies. Slow
      growth rate of the cyst makes its incidence increase with aging. Here we
      report on a seven-year-old girl who presented with central diabetes
      insipidus (CDI). Her sella MRI revealed a lesion in the sellar region
      which grew rapidly in follow-up. She underwent microneurosurgical
      operation and the lesion was totally excised. Pathologic examination
      revealed RCC with degenerative changes. In her follow-up, growth hormone
      deficiency developed in addition to arginine vasopressin deficiency. Rapid
      growth of the cyst is not the usual course of RCC's. Mechanisms regarding
      the cyst growth are unclear as they are in this case. This is the youngest
      child to date presenting with central diabetes insipidus due to RCC. Rapid
      growth of RCC can cause CDI in young children.

PG  - 573-5
AB  - A 65-year-old male, who had undergone an esophagectomy for esophageal
      cancer at the age of 53, presented a mediastinal growthing thymic cyst.
      The computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      demonstrated a cystic and thick wall in the anterosuperior mediastinum,
      and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed
      strongly positive finding. Operation was performed and histological
      examination demonstrated thymic squamous carcinoma arising from thymic
      cyst. He underwent postoperative radiotherapy and survives 5 years after
      operation. As thymic cancer with thymic cyst is very rare, we presented
      this case with a review of the literature.

TI  - [Experience of a vascular stent placement under bronchoscopy for a severe
      airway stenosis like a pinhole]
PG  - 556-60
AB  - The patient was a 32-year-old woman. She suffered repeated hemoptysis due
      to a congenital right pulmonary artery deficiency and underwent right
      pneumonectomy at 19 years of age. Immediately after the operation,
      postpneumonectomy syndrome appeared. The left main bronchus was compressed
      and almost obstructed, and so metallic stent was urgently installed.
      However, she subsequently suffered from repeated stenosis due to
      granulation and repeated obstructive pneumonia. She underwent 7 stent
      installations, laser therapy, low dose radiotherapy, and ballooning to
      treat her airway stenosis. However, her left main bronchus gradually
      became a severe stenosis like a pinhole. When she admitted to our hospital
      due to obstructive pneumonia last time, it was impossible to install usual
      airway stents because of extreme kinking of airway and severe stenosis.
      Therefore, a vascular stent for iliac artery was chosen to treat her
      airway stenosis and the stent was placed to regain good patency. As a
      result of the treatment, she had immediate relief of symptoms and survived
      obstructive pneumonia.

TI  - Association of SNPs on CAPN1 and CAST genes with tenderness in Nellore
      cattle.
PG  - 1431-42
AB  - We examined whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the calpain
      (CAPN) and calpastatin (CAST) genes, described from Bos primigenius
      taurus, are polymorphic in Nellore cattle. We also looked for a possible
      association of linkage disequilibrium of this polymorphism with tenderness
      of the longissimus dorsi muscle after 7, 14 and 21 days of postmortem
      aging in 638 purebred Nellore bulls. Meat tenderness was measured as
      Warner-Bratzler shear force. Additive and dominance effects were tested
      for SNPs of the three genotypic classes; the substitution effect was
      tested for SNPs with missing genotypic classes. Genotypic and gene
      frequencies were also calculated for the different SNPs. An increase in
      tenderness was observed from 7 to 21 days; the average values for shear
      force at 7, 14 and 21 days of aging were 5.92 +/- 0.06, 4.92 +/- 0.05, and
      4.38 +/- 0.04 kg, respectively. All markers showed polymorphism, but there
      was no CC genotype for CAPN316, and few animals showed the AA genotype for
      CAPN530. The alleles CAPN4751, UOGCAST1, and WSUCAST were found to have
      additive and dominance effects for shear force at 7, 14 and 21 days, while
      CAPN316 showed a substitution effect for shear force at 7 and 21 days. An
      additive-by-additive epistatic interaction was observed between CAPN4751
      and markers on the CAST gene. In conclusion, these markers should be
      considered for use in breeding programs.

TI  - Protective effect of high protein and calcium intake on the risk of hip
      fracture in the Framingham Offspring Cohort.
AB  - The effect of protein on bone is controversial and calcium intake may
      modify protein's effect on bone. We evaluated associations of energy
      adjusted tertiles of protein intake (total, animal, plant, animal:plant
      ratio) with incident hip fracture and if total calcium intake modified
      these associations in the Framingham Offspring Study. 1,752 men and 1,972
      women completed a baseline food frequency questionnaire (1991-95 or
      1995-98) and were followed for hip fracture until 2005. Hazard ratios (HR)
      were estimated using Cox-proportional hazards regression adjusting for
      confounders. Baseline mean age was 55 years (SD: 9.9, range: 26-86 years).
      44 hip fractures occurred over 12-years of follow-up. Due to significant
      interaction between protein (total, animal, animal:plant ratio) and
      calcium intake (P interaction range=0.03-0.04), stratified results are
      presented. Among those with calcium intakes &lt;800mg/d, the highest tertile
      (T3) of animal protein intake had 2.8 times risk of hip fracture (HR:
      2.84, 95%CI: 1.20-6.74, P=0.02) vs. the lowest tertile (T1, P-trend=0.02).
      In the &gt;/=800mg/d group, T3 of animal protein had an 85% reduced hip
      fracture risk (HR: 0.15, 95%CI: 0.02-0.92, P=0.04) vs. T1 (P-trend=0.04).
      Total protein intake and the animal:plant ratio were not significantly
      associated with hip fracture (P-range=0.12-0.65). Our results from
      middle-aged men and women show that higher animal protein intake coupled
      with calcium intake &gt;/=800mg/d may protect against hip fracture, while the
      effect appears reversed for those with lower calcium intake. Calcium
      intake modifies the association of protein intake and the risk of hip
      fracture in this cohort, and may explain the lack of concordance seen in
      previous studies. (c) 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

TI  - Varying ratios of wavelengths in dual wavelength LED photomodulation
      alters gene expression profiles in human skin fibroblasts.
PG  - 540-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: LED photomodulation has been shown to profoundly
      influence cellular behavior. A variety of parameters with LED
      photomodulation can alter cellular response in vitro. The effects of one
      visible and one infrared wavelength were evaluated to determine the
      optimal ratio to produce a net increase in dermal collagen by altering the
      ratio of total energy output of each wavelength. The ratio between the two
      wavelengths (590 and 870 nm) was shifted in 25% increments. STUDY
      DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human skin fibroblasts in culture were
      exposed to a 590/870 nm LED array with total combined energy density fixed
      at 4.0 mW/cm.. The ratio of 590/870 nm tested parameters were: 100/0%,
      75/25%, 50/50%, 25/75%, and 0/100%. These ratios were delivered using
      pulsed duty cycle of exposure (250 milliseconds "on" time/100 milliseconds
      "off" time/100 pulses) for a total energy fluence of 0.1 J/cm.. Gene
      expression was examined using commercially available extra cellular matrix
      and adhesion molecule RT PCR Arrays (SA Biosciences, Fredrick, MD) at 24
      hours post-exposure. RESULTS: Different expression profiles were noticed
      for each of the ratios studied. Overall, there was an average (in an 80
      gene array) of 6% expression difference in up or downregulation between
      the arrays. The greatest increase in collagen I and decrease in
      collagenase (MMP-1) was observed with 75/25% ratio of 590/870 nm. The
      addition of increasing proportions of IR wavelengths causes alteration in
      gene expression profile. The ratios of the wavelengths caused variation in
      magnitude of expression. CONCLUSIONS: Cell metabolism and gene expression
      can be altered by simultaneous exposure to multiple wavelengths of low
      energy light. Varying the ratios of specific wavelength intensity in both
      visible and near infrared light therapy can strongly influence resulting
      fibroblast gene expression patterns. Lasers Surg. Med. 42:540-545, 2010.

TI  - Changes in phenolic compounds and Rancimat stability of olive oils from
      varieties of olives at different stages of ripeness.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, diets rich in natural foods and food-derived
      components, such as phenolic compounds, have received a great deal of
      attention because they are perceived as 'safe' and 'non-medicinal'. In
      fact, some are known to function as chemopreventive agents against
      oxidative damage, cerebrovascular disease, and aging.RESULTS: Phenolic
      compounds, natural antioxidants present in virgin olive oil, play an
      important role in oil quality by contributing significantly to protecting
      oil stability against oxidation. In addition, polyphenols are the main
      contributors to olive oil bitterness, astringency and pungency. The data
      were fit by linear regression, giving Rancimat stability (h) = 0.18x Total
      polyphenols (mg L(-1)) in the virgin olive oil.CONCLUSIONS: The practice
      of harvesting ripe olives as soon as possible to produce oils of high
      phenolic contents and thus high oxidative stability implies bitter and
      piquant oils, this being admissible for oils of some varieties but
      detrimental to others appreciated in the market for being more fruity and
      sweeter. Copyright (c) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - [The development and effectiveness of telecare from an integrated
      technological, humanistic and management perspective.]
PG  - 83-8
AB  - A decreasing birthrate coupled with a growing elderly population has lead
      to an increased focus on elderly-centric issues such as long-term care and
      senior healthcare. Recent advances in information, communication and
      biomedical technologies have combined to allow the development of various
      types of telemedicine technology designed to enhance or expand patient
      services and care. To date, most telecare studies have focused on the
      development of underlying technologies rather than on patient (customer)
      perceptions regarding service mechanisms. The lack of the latter makes
      obtaining an effective understanding of the actual needs and problems of
      the elderly population difficult, and limits the potential for clinical
      implementation of study findings and further knowledge development. This
      article reviews important articles in the literature on telecare and
      evaluates the effectiveness of telecare-related technologies. Three key
      aspects associated with eight sub-indictors were identified. These
      included the aspects of technology (system quality); humanism
      (institutional trust and privacy risk); and management (service quality,
      cost benefit, satisfaction, use intention, and influence on health). An
      integrated perspective combining social and technological aspects is
      needed to facilitate increasing utilization of and satisfaction with
      telecare. Simply implementing new systems built around this innovative
      technology is not sufficient, and may be counterproductive. This article
      was written to help stimulate deeper exploration and insights into
      academic theory and clinical practice in order to help shape and create a
      better vision of aging in place.

TI  - [Taiwan long-term care insurance and the evolution of long-term care in
      Japan.]
PG  - 77-82
AB  - The proportion of elderly (65 years of age and older) in Taiwan has
      exceeded 10% since 2008. With more elderly, the number of patients
      suffering from dementia and disabilities has also been rapidly increasing.
      Japan also has been facing increasing demand for long-term care due to an
      aging society. Prior to 2000, social welfare programs in Japan, working to
      cope with changing needs, typically provided insufficient services, and
      geriatric patients were hospitalized unnecessarily, wasting medical
      resources and causing undue patient hardship. In response, Japan launched
      its long-term care insurance program in April 2000. Under the program,
      city, town and village-based organizations should take responsibility for
      providing care to the elderly in their place of residence. The program
      significantly improved previous financial shortfalls and long-term care
      supply and demand has been met by existing social welfare organization
      resources. In Taiwan, the provision of long-term care by county / city
      authorities has proven inconsistent, with performance deemed poor after
      its first decade of long-term care operations. Service was found to be
      affected by differences in available resources and insufficient long-term
      care administration. The cultures of Taiwan and Japan are similar. The
      authors visited the Japan Long-Term Care Insurance Institute in August
      2009. Main issues involved in the implementation and evolution of the
      Japan long-term Care Insurance are reported on in this paper. We hope such
      may be useful information to those working to develop long-term care
      programs in Taiwan.

TI  - Effects of risedronate on bone marrow adipocytes in postmenopausal women.
AB  - Aminobisphosphonates promote osteoblastogenesis while inhibiting
      adipogenesis in vitro. Their effect on adipogenesis in vivo remains
      unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that risedronate prevents marrow
      fat infiltration in postmenopausal women after 3 years of treatment.
      INTRODUCTION: Age-related bone loss is associated with high levels of
      adipogenesis within the bone marrow at the expense of osteoblast
      population. Bisphosphonates stimulate osteoblastogenesis while inhibiting
      adipogenesis in vitro. In the present study, we tested whether the effect
      of bisphosphonates on marrow adipogenesis in vitro is also seen in vivo.
      METHODS: We analyzed transiliac bone biopsies from a randomized,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effects of
      risedronate treatment 5 mg/day on vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in
      women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Paired bone biopsies were obtained
      from a subset of patients at baseline and after treatment with placebo or
      risedronate for 3 years (n = 14 per group). Biopsies were stained with
      toluidine blue and hematoxylin/eosin. Adipocyte volume/tissue volume
      (AV/TV), mean adipocyte number (AD(#)), and mean adipocyte diameter
      (AD(diam)) were quantified. Finally, expression levels of the adipogenesis
      transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activator gamma 2
      (PPARgamma2) within the bone marrow were quantified using
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In the placebo group, AV/TV, AD(#), and
      AD(diam) significantly increased after 3 years (~15%, p &lt; 0.01). In
      contrast, AD(diam) remained unchanged and AV/TV and AD(#) were
      significantly reduced (~20%) in the risedronate group at 3 years (p &lt;
      0.01). These changes were associated with a significant reduction in
      PPARgamma2 expression in the bone marrow of risedronate-treated women.
      CONCLUSIONS: Risedronate reduces bone marrow fat in postmenopausal women.
      These findings are the first demonstration of an effect of bisphosphonates
      on marrow fat in humans in vivo. By regulating the amount of fat within
      the bone marrow, this effect may contribute to the beneficial effect of
      bisphosphonates on bone mass.

TI  - A comparative study of age-related hearing loss in wild type and
      insulin-like growth factor I deficient mice.
PG  - 27
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) belongs to the family of
      insulin-related peptides that fulfils a key role during the late
      development of the nervous system. Human IGF1 mutations cause profound
      deafness, poor growth and mental retardation. Accordingly, Igf1(-/-) null
      mice are dwarfs that have low survival rates, cochlear alterations and
      severe sensorineural deafness. Presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) is a
      common disorder associated with aging that causes social and cognitive
      problems. Aging is also associated with a decrease in circulating IGF-I
      levels and this reduction has been related to cognitive and brain
      alterations, although there is no information as yet regarding the
      relationship between presbycusis and IGF-I biodisponibility. Here we
      present a longitudinal study of wild type Igf1(+/+) and null Igf1(-/-)
      mice from 2 to 12 months of age comparing the temporal progression of
      several parameters: hearing, brain morphology, cochlear cytoarchitecture,
      insulin-related factors and IGF gene expression and IGF-I serum levels.
      Complementary invasive and non-invasive techniques were used, including
      auditory brainstem-evoked response (ABR) recordings and in vivo MRI brain
      imaging. Igf1(-/-) null mice presented profound deafness at all the ages
      studied, without any obvious worsening of hearing parameters with aging.
      Igf1(+/+) wild type mice suffered significant age-related hearing loss,
      their auditory thresholds and peak I latencies augmenting as they aged, in
      parallel with a decrease in the circulating levels of IGF-I. Accordingly,
      there was an age-related spiral ganglion degeneration in wild type mice
      that was not evident in the Igf1 null mice. However, the Igf1(-/-) null
      mice in turn developed a prematurely aged stria vascularis reminiscent of
      the diabetic strial phenotype. Our data indicate that IGF-I is required
      for the correct development and maintenance of hearing, supporting the
      idea that IGF-I-based therapies could contribute to prevent or ameliorate
      age-related hearing loss.

TI  - Rad3 Decorates Critical Chromosomal Domains with gammaH2A to Protect
      Genome Integrity during S-Phase in Fission Yeast.
PG  - e1001032
AB  - Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad3 checkpoint kinase and its human ortholog
      ATR are essential for maintaining genome integrity in cells treated with
      genotoxins that damage DNA or arrest replication forks. Rad3 and ATR also
      function during unperturbed growth, although the events triggering their
      activation and their critical functions are largely unknown. Here, we use
      ChIP-on-chip analysis to map genomic loci decorated by phosphorylated
      histone H2A (gammaH2A), a Rad3 substrate that establishes a
      chromatin-based recruitment platform for Crb2 and Brc1 DNA
      repair/checkpoint proteins. Unexpectedly, gammaH2A marks a diverse array
      of genomic features during S-phase, including natural replication fork
      barriers and a fork breakage site, retrotransposons, heterochromatin in
      the centromeres and telomeres, and ribosomal RNA (rDNA) repeats. gammaH2A
      formation at the centromeres and telomeres is associated with
      heterochromatin establishment by Clr4 histone methyltransferase. We show
      that gammaH2A domains recruit Brc1, a factor involved in repair of damaged
      replication forks. Brc1 C-terminal BRCT domain binding to gammaH2A is
      crucial in the absence of Rqh1(Sgs1), a RecQ DNA helicase required for
      rDNA maintenance whose human homologs are mutated in patients with Werner,
      Bloom, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes that are characterized by
      cancer-predisposition or accelerated aging. We conclude that Rad3
      phosphorylates histone H2A to mobilize Brc1 to critical genomic domains
      during S-phase, and this pathway functions in parallel with Rqh1 DNA
      helicase in maintaining genome integrity.

PG  - 302-8
AB  - In the United States, the issue of aging workers in the nursing workforce
      is one of growing concern with greater than 33% of RNs older than 50
      years. The implementation of creative strategies to offset the loss of
      nurses' experiential knowledge has the potential to improve patient care
      and reduce risk to patients. The author proposes a program of phased
      retirement as an innovative approach to the anticipated loss of nursing
      knowledge related to retirement of the nursing workforce. The business
      case for support for phased retirement is discussed.

      Rats.
PG  - 525-9
AB  - The Spontaneously Diabetic Torii-Lepr(fa) (SDT-fa/fa) rat, a new model of
      obese type 2 diabetes, shows obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia
      from 6 weeks of age. Diabetic complications such as nephropathy and
      cataract are observed with aging; however, blood pressure change with age
      has not previously been examined. In this study, blood pressure was
      periodically measured and the change was investigated. Blood pressure in
      male SDT-fa/fa rats was elevated at 8, 16, and 24 weeks of age, whereas
      the heart rate was not changed. In addition to hyperglycemia,
      hyperlipidemia, and proteinuria, hyperleptinemia and increased urine
      angiotensinogen were observed in SDT-fa/fa rats. Blood pressure and heart
      rate in the male original SDT (SDT-+/+) rat did not significantly change.
      In conclusion, the SDT-fa/fa rat is a promising model, showing significant
      hypertension with diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Correlates of Echocardiographic Indices of Cardiac Remodeling Over the
      Adult Life Course. Longitudinal Observations From the Framingham Heart
      Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: -The heart progressively remodels over the life course, yet
      longitudinal data characterizing such remodeling in the community are
      limited. Methods and Results-Using multilevel modeling, we analyzed up to
      4 serial echocardiographic observations obtained over a 16-year period in
      4062 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age 45 years, 54% women; 11
      485 person-observations). We related left ventricular (LV) wall thickness,
      LV systolic and diastolic dimensions, and fractional shortening to age,
      sex, body mass index, blood pressure (including antihypertensive
      medication use), smoking, and diabetes mellitus (separate analyses for
      each echocardiographic measure). With advancing age, LV dimensions
      decreased, whereas fractional shortening and LV wall thickness increased
      concomitantly. Male sex, body mass index, and blood pressure
      indices/hypertension treatment were significantly related to both greater
      LV dimensions and LV wall thickness. The effect of age on cardiac
      remodeling was influenced by key covariates (P&lt;0.05 for all interactions):
      Women and individuals with diabetes mellitus experienced greater
      age-associated increases in LV wall thickness; presence of diabetes or a
      higher blood pressure was associated with a lesser decrease in LV
      diastolic dimensions with increasing age; and antihypertensive medication
      use was a marker of an attenuated increase in fractional shortening with
      aging. Conclusions-Cardiac remodeling over the adult life course is
      characterized by a distinct pattern of increasing LV wall thickness,
      decreasing LV dimensions, and increasing fractional shortening with
      advancing age. Overall, female sex, greater blood pressure load, and
      presence of diabetes mellitus serve to attenuate this remodeling pattern.
      These observations suggest a mechanism for the preponderance of women with
      hypertension and individuals with diabetes among patients with diastolic
      heart failure.

TI  - Polybromo-associated BRG1-associated factor components BRD7 and BAF180 are
      critical regulators of p53 required for induction of replicative
      senescence.
AB  - A variety of tumor-suppressor mechanisms exist to promote genome integrity
      and organismal survival. One such mechanism is cellular senescence. In
      response to replicative aging, DNA damage, and oncogenic stimuli, the p53
      and Rb pathways are activated to prevent the proliferation of damaged
      cells by inducing senescence or apoptosis. We have performed a
      loss-of-function genetic screen in primary human cells to identify
      components of the senescence machinery. Here we describe BRD7 and BAF180
      as unique regulators of replicative senescence in human cells. Both
      regulate p53 transcriptional activity toward a subset of its target genes
      required for replicative and oncogenic stress senescence induction, and
      BRD7 physically interacts with p53. BRD7 is a deletion target in human
      cancer, suggesting that loss of BRD7 may provide an additional mechanism
      to antagonize p53 function in cancer cells.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis reveals mechanisms modulating autophagy in normal
      brain aging and in Alzheimer's disease.
AB  - Dysregulation of autophagy, a cellular catabolic mechanism essential for
      degradation of misfolded proteins, has been implicated in multiple
      neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms that lead to the
      autophagy dysfunction are still not clear. Based on the results of a
      genome-wide screen, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as
      common mediators upstream of the activation of the type III PI3 kinase,
      which is critical for the initiation of autophagy. Furthermore, ROS play
      an essential function in the induction of the type III PI3 kinase and
      autophagy in response to amyloid beta peptide, the main pathogenic
      mediator of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, lysosomal blockage also
      caused by Abeta is independent of ROS. In addition, we demonstrate that
      autophagy is transcriptionally down-regulated during normal aging in the
      human brain. Strikingly, in contrast to normal aging, we observe
      transcriptional up-regulation of autophagy in the brains of AD patients,
      suggesting that there might be a compensatory regulation of autophagy.
      Interestingly, we show that an AD drug and an AD drug candidate have
      inhibitory effects on autophagy,raising the possibility that decreasing
      input into the lysosomal system may help to reduce cellular stress in AD.
      Finally, we provide a list of candidate drug targets that can be used to
      safely modulate levels of autophagy without causing cell death.

TI  - Do Patients with Schizophrenia and Healthy Elderly People show Similar
      Patterns of Prospective Memory Performance?
AB  - Schizophrenia and normal aging have both been associated with structural
      and physiological changes in the prefrontal and temporal cortex and
      impairments in prospective memory (PM). This study aimed to compare PM
      performance in patients with schizophrenia, healthy older, and healthy
      younger individuals. Computerized event- and time-based PM tasks were
      administered to 30 patients with schizophrenia, 30 healthy older adults,
      and 30 healthy younger adults. The healthy older adults and patients with
      schizophrenia demonstrated deficits in time-based PM when compared with
      the healthy younger adults. However, only healthy older adults were found
      to be impaired in event-based PM when compared with the healthy younger
      adults. These findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia show a
      similar pattern of performance on one type but not another type of PM and
      provide only partial support for the accelerated aging hypothesis of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Senior-friendly Emergency Department care: an environmental assessment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the environment of an Emergency Department (ED) and
      its impact on care of adults aged 75 and over, using a 'senior-friendly'
      conceptual framework that included the physical environment, social
      climate, hospital policies and procedures, and wider health care system.
      METHODS: In this focused ethnography, we collected and analysed data from
      the ED of a regional acute care hospital located in Ontario, Canada from
      October 2007 to January 2008. Data collection included interviews with
      seniors or their proxy decision-makers, staff and key community
      informants; on-site observations; a staff survey; and hospital
      administrative data. Data sets were individually analysed and a synthesis
      of findings developed to formulate recommendations for policy, practice
      and education. RESULTS: Staff expressed their vision of providing
      senior-friendly care. However, the ED was fast-paced, overcrowded, chaotic
      and lacked orientation and wayfinding cues, as well as appropriate
      equipment and furniture, all of which created barriers to providing
      appropriate care. Seniors' expectations often went unmet and staff
      expressed moral angst at recognizing unmet needs. Some hospital policies
      and procedures compounded these difficulties, including hallway practice,
      lack of off-hour access to multidisciplinary health care professionals,
      and the inability of patients to access food and drink. Better
      communication and coordination between the ED and other components of the
      health care system are needed. CONCLUSIONS: The ED is an important part of
      seniors' health care. Changes to policy and practices, and enhanced
      education must occur to better meet the complex health care needs of
      seniors. This assessment provides a method that can be replicated
      elsewhere to generate site-specific recommendations and initiate capacity
      development processes to enhance senior-friendly care.

TI  - SIRT1 is regulated by a PPAR{gamma}-SIRT1 negative feedback loop
      associated with senescence.
AB  - Human Silent Information Regulator Type 1 (SIRT1) is an NAD(+)-dependent
      deacetylase protein which is an intermediary of cellular metabolism in
      gene silencing and aging. SIRT1 has been extensively investigated and
      shown to delay senescence; however, less is known about the regulation of
      SIRT1 during aging. In this study, we show that the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), which is a
      ligand-regulated modular nuclear receptor that governs adipocyte
      differentiation and inhibits cellular proliferation, inhibits SIRT1
      expression at the transcriptional level. Moreover, both PPARgamma and
      SIRT1 can bind the SIRT1 promoter. PPARgamma directly interacts with SIRT1
      and inhibits SIRT1 activity, forming a negative feedback and
      self-regulation loop. In addition, our data show that acetylation of
      PPARgamma increased with increasing cell passage number. We propose that
      PPARgamma is subject to regulation by acetylation and deacetylation via
      p300 and SIRT1 in cellular senescence. These results demonstrate a mutual
      regulation between PPARgamma and SIRT1 and identify a new
      posttranslational modification that affects cellular senescence.

TI  - Translation of a Dementia Caregiver Intervention for Delivery in Homecare
      as a Reimbursable Medicare Service: Outcomes and Lessons Learned.
AB  - PURPOSE: Families of dementia patients receiving skilled homecare do not
      receive supportive services. We evaluated whether a proven intervention,
      Environmental Skill-building Program (ESP), which reduces caregiver burden
      and enhances skills managing patient functioning, can be integrated into
      homecare practices of occupational therapists (OTs) and reimbursed through
      Medicare Part B. DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2-year translational project with a
      homecare practice was conducted. Five translational activities included
      refining ESP, site preparation, therapist training, establishing referral
      mechanisms, and evaluating outcomes using Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM). RESULTS: Of 30 OTs approached for
      participation, 23 (77%) agreed, 22 (96%) completed training, and 21
      (95.5%) used ESP and intended to continue use. Of 69 eligible caregivers,
      41 (59%) agreed to participate averaging 4.7 sessions. Of 20 returned
      caregiver surveys, enhancements were reported in all targeted areas of
      knowledge and skills. Fidelity monitoring revealed inconsistency in
      therapists use of problem solving, yet caregiver enactment of ESP
      strategies was high. ESP sessions integrated within patient-directed
      therapy were reimbursed by Medicare Part B. IMPLICATIONS: RE-AIM
      indicators suggest moderate translational success. As ESP was reimbursed
      through Medicare B, its delivery may be sustainable and meet the needs of
      family caregivers of dementia patients receiving therapies at home.

TI  - Synergistic Effects of Long-Term Antioxidant Diet and Behavioral
      Enrichment on {beta}-Amyloid Load and Non-Amyloidogenic Processing in Aged
      Canines.
PG  - 9831-9
AB  - A long-term intervention (2.69 years) with an antioxidant diet, behavioral
      enrichment, or the combined treatment preserved and improved cognitive
      function in aged canines. Although each intervention alone provided
      cognitive benefits, the combination treatment was additive. We evaluate
      the hypothesis that antioxidants, enrichment, or the combination
      intervention reduces age-related beta-amyloid (Abeta) neuropathology, as
      one mechanism mediating observed functional improvements. Measures
      assessed were Abeta neuropathology in plaques, biochemically extractable
      Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) species, soluble oligomeric forms of Abeta, and
      various proteins in the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing
      pathway. The strongest and most consistent effects on Abeta pathology were
      observed in animals receiving the combined antioxidant and enrichment
      treatment. Specifically, Abeta plaque load was significantly decreased in
      several brain regions, soluble Abeta(42) was decreased selectively in the
      frontal cortex, and a trend for lower Abeta oligomer levels was found in
      the parietal cortex. Reductions in Abeta may be related to shifted APP
      processing toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway, because alpha-secretase
      enzymatic activity was increased in the absence of changes in
      beta-secretase activity. Although enrichment alone had no significant
      effects on Abeta, reduced Abeta load and plaque maturation occurred in
      animals receiving antioxidants as a component of treatment. Abeta measures
      did not correlate with cognitive performance on any of the six tasks
      assessed, suggesting that modulation of Abeta alone may be a relatively
      minor mechanism mediating cognitive benefits of the interventions.
      Overall, the data indicate that multidomain treatments may be a valuable
      intervention strategy to reduce neuropathology and improve cognitive
      function in humans.

PG  - 9771-9781
AB  - The subependymal zone (SEZ) of the lateral ventricles is one of the areas
      of the adult brain where new neurons are continuously generated from
      neural stem cells (NSCs), via rapidly dividing precursors. This neurogenic
      niche is a complex cellular and extracellular microenvironment, highly
      vascularized compared to non-neurogenic periventricular areas, within
      which NSCs and precursors exhibit distinct behavior. Here, we investigate
      the possible mechanisms by which extracellular matrix molecules and their
      receptors might regulate this differential behavior. We show that NSCs and
      precursors proceed through mitosis in the same domains within the SEZ of
      adult male mice-albeit with NSCs nearer ependymal cells-and that distance
      from the ventricle is a stronger limiting factor for neurogenic activity
      than distance from blood vessels. Furthermore, we show that NSCs and
      precursors are embedded in a laminin-rich extracellular matrix, to which
      they can both contribute. Importantly, they express differential levels of
      extracellular matrix receptors, with NSCs expressing low levels of
      alpha6beta1 integrin, syndecan-1, and lutheran, and in vivo blocking of
      beta1 integrin selectively induced the proliferation and ectopic migration
      of precursors. Finally, when NSCs are activated to reconstitute the niche
      after depletion of precursors, expression of laminin receptors is
      upregulated. These results indicate that the distinct behavior of adult
      NSCs and precursors is not necessarily regulated via exposure to
      differential extracellular signals, but rather via intrinsic regulation of
      their interaction with their microenvironment.

TI  - SIRT1 Is Essential for Normal Cognitive Function and Synaptic Plasticity.
PG  - 9695-9707
AB  - Conservation of normal cognitive functions relies on the proper
      performance of the nervous system at the cellular and molecular level. The
      mammalian nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase SIRT1
      impacts different processes potentially involved in the maintenance of
      brain integrity, such as chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, cell survival,
      and neurogenesis. Here we show that SIRT1 is expressed in neurons of the
      hippocampus, a key structure in learning and memory. Using a combination
      of behavioral and electrophysiological paradigms, we analyzed the effects
      of SIRT1 deficiency and overexpression on mouse learning and memory as
      well as on synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that the absence of SIRT1
      impaired cognitive abilities, including immediate memory, classical
      conditioning, and spatial learning. In addition, we found that the
      cognitive deficits in SIRT1 knock-out (KO) mice were associated with
      defects in synaptic plasticity without alterations in basal synaptic
      transmission or NMDA receptor function. Brains of SIRT1-KO mice exhibited
      normal morphology and dendritic spine structure but displayed a decrease
      in dendritic branching, branch length, and complexity of neuronal
      dendritic arbors. Also, a decrease in extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and altered expression of hippocampal genes
      involved in synaptic function, lipid metabolism, and myelination were
      detected in SIRT1-KO mice. In contrast, mice with high levels of SIRT1
      expression in brain exhibited regular synaptic plasticity and memory. We
      conclude that SIRT1 is indispensable for normal learning, memory, and
      synaptic plasticity in mice.

TI  - Cytomegalovirus Antibody Levels, Inflammation, and Mortality Among Elderly
      Latinos Over 9 Years of Follow-up.
AB  - This study examined the relation between immune response to
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      mortality, and possible mediating mechanisms. Data were derived from the
      Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging, a population-based study of older
      Latinos (aged 60-101 years) in California followed in 1998-2008. CMV
      immunoglobulin G (IgG), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 were
      assayed from baseline blood draws. Data on all-cause and CVD mortality
      were abstracted from death certificates. Analyses included 1,468 of 1,789
      participants. For individuals with CMV IgG antibody titers in the highest
      quartile compared with lower quartiles, fully adjusted models showed that
      all-cause mortality was 1.43 times (95% confidence interval: 1.14, 1.79)
      higher over 9 years. In fully adjusted models, the hazard of CVD mortality
      was also elevated (hazard ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence interval: 1.01,
      1.80). A composite measure of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6
      mediated a substantial proportion of the association between CMV and
      all-cause (18.9%, P &lt; 0.001) and CVD (29.0%, P = 0.02) mortality. This
      study is the first known to show that high CMV IgG antibody levels are
      significantly related to mortality and that the relation is largely
      mediated by interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. Further studies
      investigating methods for reducing IgG antibody response to CMV are
      warranted.

TI  - Not Saying I Am Happy Does Not Mean I Am Not: Cultural Influences on
      Responses to Positive Affect Items in the CES-D.
AB  - Objectives. Given the emphasis on modesty and self-effacement in Asian
      societies, the present study explored differential item responses for 2
      positive affect items (5 = Hopeful and 8 = Happy) on a short form of the
      Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. The samples consisted
      of elderly non-Hispanic Whites (n = 450), Korean Americans (n = 519), and
      Koreans (n = 2,030). Method. Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause models were
      estimated to identify the impact of group membership on responses to the
      positive affect items while controlling for the latent trait of depressive
      symptoms. RESULTS: The data revealed that Koreans and Korean Americans
      were less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to endorse the positive affect
      items. Compared with Korean Americans who were more acculturated to
      mainstream American culture, those who were less acculturated were less
      likely to endorse the positive affect items. Discussion. Our findings
      support the notion that the way in which people endorse depressive
      symptoms is substantially influenced by cultural orientation. These
      findings call into question the common use of simple mean comparisons and
      a universal cutoff point across diverse cultural groups.

AB  - Wearable technology may provide an integral part of the solution for
      providing health care to a growing world population that will be strained
      by a ballooning aging population. By providing a means to conduct
      telemedicine-the monitoring, recording, and transmission of physiological
      signals from outside of the hospital-wearable technology solutions could
      ease the burden on health-care personnel and use hospital space for more
      emergent or responsive care. In addition, employing wearable technology in
      professions where workers are exposed to dangers or hazards could help
      save their lives and protect health-care personnel.

TI  - Wireless sensing systems in clinical environments: improving the
      efficiency of the patient monitoring process.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - Multiple studies suggest that the level of patient care may decline in the
      future because of a larger aging population and medical staff shortages.
      Wireless sensing systems that automate some of the patient monitoring
      tasks can potentially improve the efficiency of patient workflows, but
      their efficacy in clinical settings is an open question. This article
      examines the potential of wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies to
      improve the efficiency of the patient-monitoring process in clinical
      environments. MEDiSN, a WSN designed to continuously monitor the vital
      signs of ambulatory patients, is designed. The usefulness of MEDiSN is
      validated with test bed experiments and results from a pilot study
      performed at the Emergency Department, Johns Hopkins Hospital. Promising
      results indicate that MEDiSN can tolerate high degrees of human mobility,
      is well received by patients and staff members, and performs well in real
      clinical environments.

      surgical rejuvenation of the upper eyelid with an emphasis on the eyelid
      anatomy, aging of the eyes, clinical evaluation, surgical technique, and
      postoperative complications. The paradigm has shifted to a more
      conservative resection of skin, muscle, and fat to preserve fullness to
      the upper eyelid that portrays youthfulness.

TI  - Periocular Rejuvenation: Lower Eyelid Blepharoplasty with Fat
      Repositioning and the Suborbicularis Oculi Fat.
PG  - 399-409
AB  - Treatment of the aging lower eyelid is determined by the anatomic
      variables noted for each surgical candidate. Although surgeons have
      traditionally considered dermatochalasis, fat pseudoherniation, and eyelid
      position as the main treatment objectives in lower blepharoplasty, the
      vector of the infraorbital rim and the anterior plane of the cornea, tear
      trough, and aging in the midface also merit critical consideration. In
      this article, indications and technical aspects, the transconjunctival and
      external approaches, fat excision versus fat repositioning, and
      suborbicularis oculi fat lifting and fat transplantation are discussed and
      the authors' preference for the various methods of lower blepharoplasty is
      presented. Common adjunct procedures used to supplement lower
      blepharoplasty techniques and the role of injectable fillers in periocular
      rejuvenation are also mentioned.

TI  - Midface Restoration in the Management of the Lower Eyelid.
PG  - 365-374
AB  - Aging of the midface and lower eyelid represents one of the earliest
      clinically detectable areas of aging on the face. These senile changes
      include laxity of eyelid skin, pseudoherniation of orbital fat, ptosis of
      the suborbicularis oculi and malar fat pads, and loss of facial volume.
      Several approaches, including surgical and nonsurgical procedures, have
      been developed to counter the effects of aging on the midface and lower
      eyelid. This article reviews the techniques used by the authors to
      rejuvenate the midface and lower eyelid, and illustrates a comprehensive
      approach to management of this complex facial region.

      about the EP workforce to assess training of arrhythmic healthcare
      providers in order the meet the requisite societal need. This report
      summarizes the data collected by the HRS Workforce Study Task Force in
      relation to physician workforce issues. OBJECTIVE: The HRS Workforce Study
      Task Force was charged with conducting a comprehensive study to assess
      changes in the field of electrophysiology since the last workforce study
      conducted in 2001 and to identify the population and distribution of
      professionals who treat patients with heart rhythm disorders. METHODS: A
      series of comprehensive questionnaires were designed by the HRS Workforce
      Study Task Force to conduct on-line surveys with physicians, basic science
      researchers, and allied professionals. Data collected in the physician
      survey included: personal demographics and professional profile
      characteristics such as primary work setting and areas of affiliation;
      workload characteristics such as hours worked, time spent by activity,
      workload relative to capacity, competition for patients, volume by
      specific procedure, sources of referrals, income levels, personal
      mobility, and anticipated future changes in the respondent's practice.
      Survey responses were collated and analyzed by the Workforce Study Task
      Force. RESULTS: Work capacity is expected to increase to offset some of
      the economic drivers; however, recruitment of new EPs could be challenging
      and uncertain. Specifically, geographic mobility (&gt;50 miles) appears to be
      minimal at present overall and unlikely to significantly change for the
      majority of physicians once they have established themselves in a given
      community following the completion of their training. Practice time is
      predominantly spent performing device implantations, device follow-ups and
      ablations. These activities are being tasked upon younger physicians,
      thereby suggesting a need for trained allied professionals to assume a
      greater role in device management. The perception of competition varied by
      respondent age and geographic location but, in general, was felt to be at
      least moderate by most respondents. Furthermore, there are concerns that
      increasing competition may dilute operator experience and potentially
      lower high quality outcomes if increasing competition leads to lower
      procedural volumes. CONCLUSION: Based on findings from this study, the
      task force identified specific workforce (supply) trends and the key
      drivers of current and future challenges. Although specific areas will
      require further analysis, overall, the current EP workforce is stable,
      with the exception of geographic dispersion. However, the workforce must
      adapt to the key economic drivers (demand) and address future recruitment
      challenges.

TI  - Remembering beauty: Roles of orbitofrontal and hippocampal regions in
      successful memory encoding of attractive faces.
AB  - Behavioral data have shown that attractive faces are better remembered but
      the neural mechanisms of this effect are largely unknown. To investigate
      this issue, female participants were scanned with event-related functional
      MRI (fMRI) while rating the attractiveness of male faces. Memory for the
      faces was tested after fMRI scanning and was used to identify successful
      encoding activity (subsequent memory paradigm). As expected, attractive
      faces were remembered better than other faces. The study yielded three
      main fMRI findings. First, activity in the right orbitofrontal cortex
      increased linearly as a function of attractiveness ratings. Second,
      activity in the left hippocampus increased as a function of subsequent
      memory (subsequent misses&lt;low-confidence hits&lt;high-confidence hits).
      Third, functional connectivity between these orbitofrontal and hippocampal
      regions was stronger during the encoding of attractive than neutral or
      unattractive faces. These results suggest that better memory for
      attractive faces reflects greater interaction between a region associated
      with reward, the orbitofrontal cortex, and a region associated with
      successful memory encoding, the hippocampus.

TI  - Improved Proper Name Recall by Electrical Stimulation of the Anterior
      Temporal Lobes.
AB  - People's names have an embarrassing propensity to be forgotten. This
      problem is exacerbated by normal aging and by some kinds of dementia. As
      evidence from neuroimaging and neuropsychology suggest that portions of
      the anterior temporal lobes play a role in proper name retrieval, we
      hypothesized that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a
      technique that modulates neural transmission, to the anterior temporal
      lobes would alter the retrieval of proper names. Fifteen young adults
      received left anodal, right anodal, or sham stimulation of the anterior
      temporal lobes while naming pictures of famous individuals and landmarks.
      Right anterior temporal lobe stimulation significantly improved naming for
      people but not landmarks. These findings are consistent with the notion
      that the anterior temporal lobes are critically involved in the retrieval
      of people's names.

TI  - VEGF-A Loss in the Haematopoietic and Endothelial Lineage Exacerbates
      Age-Induced Renal Changes.
AB  - Renal function declines with age and this is more pronounced in males than
      females. VEGF-A is essential for glomerular development and function but
      its role in other aspects of renal function is poorly understood. We
      therefore investigated the role of VEGF-A, derived specifically from
      haematopoietic and endothelial lineages in the kidney. We crossed Vav-Cre
      and floxed Vegf-a mice allowing specific ablation of a single Vegf-a
      allele in the haematopoietic and endothelial lineages. Mutants were viable
      and fertile and had normal haematological composition, indicating that 50%
      gene dosage of Vegf-a in the Vav-expressing lineage is sufficient for
      establishing a functional haematopoietic system and mature vascular
      network. However, several abnormalities were observed in the kidney of the
      adult mutants. These included the formation of inclusion bodies in the
      proximal tubular cells, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. These
      features were observed in 9-11month-old mutant animals. Most of these
      abnormalities have been described in aging kidneys in man, and were also
      observed in the older control mice (24months). The pathological features
      appeared in mutant male animals at a younger age than in female mutants.
      This indicates that reduction in Vegf-a gene dosage in haematopoietic and
      endothelial lineages accelerates renal aging, suggesting that VEGF-A
      derived from these lineages may play a role in protecting the kidney from
      age-associated damage.

TI  - Deletion of murine tau gene increases tau aggregation in a human mutant
      tau transgenic mouse model.
PG  - 1001-5
AB  - We have reported previously a tau transgenic mouse model (Tg30tau)
      overexpressing human 4R1N double-mutant tau (P301S and G272V) and that
      develops AD (Alzheimer's disease)-like NFTs (neurofibrillary tangles) in
      an age-dependent manner. Since murine tau might interfere with the toxic
      effects of human mutant tau, we set out to analyse the phenotype of our
      Tg30tau model in the absence of endogenous murine tau with the aim to
      reproduce more faithfully a model of human tauopathy. By crossing the
      Tg30tau line with TauKO (tau-knockout) mice, we have obtained a new mouse
      line called Tg30xTauKO that expresses only exogenous human double-mutant
      4R1N tau. Whereas Tg30xTauKO mice express fewer tau proteins compared with
      Tg30tau, they exhibit augmented sarkosyl-insoluble tau in the brain and an
      increased number of Gallyas-positive NFTs in the hippocampus. Taken
      together, exclusion of murine tau causes accelerated tau aggregation
      during aging of this mutant tau transgenic model.

TI  - From tau phosphorylation to tau aggregation: what about neuronal death?
PG  - 967-72
AB  - Tau pathology is characterized by intracellular aggregates of abnormally
      and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. It is encountered in many
      neurodegenerative disorders, but also in aging. These neurodegenerative
      disorders are referred to as tauopathies. Comparative biochemistry of the
      tau aggregates shows that they differ in both tau isoform phosphorylation
      and content, which enables a molecular classification of tauopathies. In
      conditions of dementia, NFD (neurofibrillary degeneration) severity is
      correlated to cognitive impairment and is often considered as neuronal
      death. Using tau animal models, analysis of the kinetics of tau
      phosphorylation, aggregation and neuronal death in parallel to
      electrophysiological and behavioural parameters indicates a disconnection
      between cognition deficits and neuronal cell death. Tau phosphorylation
      and aggregation are early events followed by cognitive impairment.
      Neuronal death is not observed before the oldest ages. A sequence of
      events may be the formation of toxic phosphorylated tau species, their
      aggregation, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (from pre-tangles to
      ghost tangles) and finally neuronal cell death. This sequence will last
      from 15 to 25 years and one can ask whether the aggregation of toxic
      phosphorylated tau species is a protection against cell death. Apoptosis
      takes 24 h, but NFD lasts for 24 years to finally kill the neuron or
      rather to protect it for more than 20 years. Altogether, these data
      suggest that NFD is a transient state before neuronal death and that
      therapeutic interventions are possible at that stage.

TI  - Initiation of DNA interstrand cross-link repair in mammalian cells.
PG  - 604-24
AB  - Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are among the most cytotoxic DNA lesions to
      cells because they prevent the two DNA strands from separating, thereby
      precluding replication and transcription. Even though chemotherapeutic
      cross-linking agents are well established in clinical use, and numerous
      repair proteins have been implicated in the initial events of mammalian
      ICL repair, the precise mechanistic details of these events remain to be
      elucidated. This review will summarize our current understanding of how
      ICL repair is initiated with an emphasis on the context (replicating,
      transcribed or quiescent DNA) in which the ICL is recognized, and how the
      chemical and physical properties of ICLs influence repair. Although most
      studies have focused on replication-dependent repair because of the
      relation to highly replicative tumor cells, replication-independent ICL
      repair is likely to be important in the circumvention of cross-link
      cytotoxicity in nondividing, terminally differentiated cells that may be
      challenged with exogenous or endogenous sources of ICLs. Consequently, the
      ICL repair pathway that should be considered "dominant" appears to depend
      on the cell type and the DNA context in which the ICL is encountered. The
      ability to define and inhibit distinct pathways of ICL repair in different
      cell cycle phases may help in developing methods that increase
      cytotoxicity to cancer cells while reducing side-effects in nondividing
      normal cells. This may also lead to a better understanding of pathways
      that protect against malignancy and aging. Environ. Mol. Mutagen., 2010.

TI  - Deficiency in core circadian protein Bmal1 is associated with a
      prothrombotic and vascular phenotype.
AB  - Aging is associated with both the disturbances of circadian rhythms and a
      prothrombotic phenotype. It remains poorly understood how the circadian
      system regulates thrombosis, a critical outcome of aging-related
      cardiovascular disease. Using multiple in vivo models, we now show that
      mice with genetic ablation of the core clock gene Bmal1, which display
      premature aging, have a dramatic prothrombotic phenotype. This phenotype
      is mechanistically linked to changes in the regulation of key risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease. These include circulating vWF, fibrinogen and
      PAI-1, all of which are significantly elevated in Bmal1(-/-) mice. We also
      show that major circadian transcriptional regulators CLOCK and
      Bmal1directly regulate the activity of vWF promoter and that lack of
      Bmal1results in up-regulation of vWF both at mRNA and protein level. Here
      we report a direct regulation of vWF expression in endothelial cells by
      biological clock gene Bmal1. This study establishes a mechanistic
      connection between Bmal1and cardiovascular phenotype. J. Cell. Physiol.

AB  - Late-life depression has attracted considerable attention in the social
      work literature. This study examined levels of knowledge and self-efficacy
      (confidence) in evaluation of depression in late life among a random
      sample of social workers (N = 168) from the National Association of Social
      Workers. Relationships among knowledge on aging, job-related variables,
      and predictors of knowledge of geriatric depression were examined.
      Participants ranked depression as one of the most frequent clinical
      problems seen in practice, scored at the lower end on knowledge about
      aging, and experienced great difficulty on the items pertaining to suicide
      in the older adults.

TI  - Multivariate Data Analysis for Neuroimaging Data: Overview and Application
      to Alzheimer's Disease.
AB  - As clinical and cognitive neuroscience mature, the need for sophisticated
      neuroimaging analysis becomes more apparent. Multivariate analysis
      techniques have recently received increasing attention as they have many
      attractive features that cannot be easily realized by the more commonly
      used univariate, voxel-wise, techniques. Multivariate approaches evaluate
      correlation/covariance of activation across brain regions, rather than
      proceeding on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Thus, their results can be more
      easily interpreted as a signature of neural networks. Univariate
      approaches, on the other hand, cannot directly address functional
      connectivity in the brain. The covariance approach can also result in
      greater statistical power when compared with univariate techniques, which
      are forced to employ very stringent, and often overly conservative,
      corrections for voxel-wise multiple comparisons. Multivariate techniques
      also lend themselves much better to prospective application of results
      from the analysis of one dataset to entirely new datasets. Multivariate
      techniques are thus well placed to provide information about mean
      differences and correlations with behavior, similarly to univariate
      approaches, with potentially greater statistical power and better
      reproducibility checks. In contrast to these advantages is the high
      barrier of entry to the use of multivariate approaches, preventing more
      widespread application in the community. To the neuroscientist becoming
      familiar with multivariate analysis techniques, an initial survey of the
      field might present a bewildering variety of approaches that, although
      algorithmically similar, are presented with different emphases, typically
      by people with mathematics backgrounds. We believe that multivariate
      analysis techniques have sufficient potential to warrant better
      dissemination. Researchers should be able to employ them in an informed
      and accessible manner. The following article attempts to provide a basic
      introduction with sample applications to simulated and real-world data
      sets.

TI  - Genome-Wide Screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Identifies Vacuolar Protein
      Sorting, Autophagy, Biosynthetic, and tRNA Methylation Genes Involved in
      Life Span Regulation.
PG  - e1001024
AB  - The study of the chronological life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
      which measures the survival of populations of non-dividing yeast, has
      resulted in the identification of homologous genes and pathways that
      promote aging in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Using a
      competitive genome-wide approach, we performed a screen of a complete set
      of approximately 4,800 viable deletion mutants to identify genes that
      either increase or decrease chronological life span. Half of the putative
      short-/long-lived mutants retested from the primary screen were confirmed,
      demonstrating the utility of our approach. Deletion of genes involved in
      vacuolar protein sorting, autophagy, and mitochondrial function shortened
      life span, confirming that respiration and degradation processes are
      essential for long-term survival. Among the genes whose deletion
      significantly extended life span are ACB1, CKA2, and TRM9, implicated in
      fatty acid transport and biosynthesis, cell signaling, and tRNA
      methylation, respectively. Deletion of these genes conferred heat-shock
      resistance, supporting the link between life span extension and cellular
      protection observed in several model organisms. The high degree of
      conservation of these novel yeast longevity determinants in other species
      raises the possibility that their role in senescence might be conserved.

TI  - Optimizing bone health in older adults: the importance of dietary protein.
PG  - 345-357
AB  - Age-related bone loss is progressive and can lead to osteoporosis. While
      it is accepted that both dietary calcium and vitamin D are important and
      beneficial for skeletal health, the impact of dietary protein on calcium
      metabolism and bone balance remains controversial. Contrary to the
      hypothesis that increasing dietary protein contributes to bone loss,
      research supports the notion that protein may play a pivotal role in
      maintenance of bone health by several mechanisms; for example, increasing
      dietary protein increases IGF-1, calcium absorption, muscle strength and
      mass, all of which could potentially benefit the skeleton. A moderate
      increase in dietary protein recommendations for the aging population
      (above the recommended dietary allowance of 0.8 g/kg) may be beneficial to
      bone health, while still falling within the safe and acceptable range for
      protein intake (as defined by the dietary reference intakes).

TI  - Arterial aging-hemodynamic changes and therapeutic options.
PG  - 442-9
AB  - Arterial aging can be attributed to two different pathophysiological
      changes-increase in arterial stiffness and disturbed wave reflections. The
      capacity of the aorta to absorb the force exerted by the left ventricular
      ejection and dampen pulsatile flow becomes diminished with advancing age,
      owing to the progressive hardening of the arterial wall. These changes
      contribute to increase blood pressure, mainly systolic blood pressure and
      pulse pressure, which can trigger cardiovascular events. Understanding the
      pulsatile arterial hemodynamics that elevate cardiovascular risk has led
      to the use of pharmacological therapies, which prevent arterial stiffness
      and reduce wave reflections, and improve cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Antifibrotic agents, such as those that block the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, are often given in association with
      diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, or both, but not with standard
      beta-blockers. Consistent reductions in cardiovascular outcomes obtained
      using these agents can be predicted through noninvasive measurements of
      central systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure.

TI  - Effect of tankyrase 1 on autophagy in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle
      cells from ageing rats with erectile dysfunction and its potential
      mechanism.
AB  - This study compared tankyrase 1 expression and autophagy quantity between
      erectile dysfunction (ED) and non-ED rats' corpus cavernosum smooth muscle
      cells (CSMCs). This study aslo explored the effect and possible mechanism
      of tankyrase 1 on autophagy and cell proliferation in ageing ED rats'
      CSMCs. The intracavernous pressure and mean systemic arterial pressure
      were measured to investigate erectile function so that eight 24-month-old
      ED and eight 8-month-old male Wistar rats were choosed respectively. The
      rat CSMCs were isolated and cultured by enzyme digestion, in which
      tankyrase 1 expression and autophagy quantity were compared. Tankyrase 1
      overexpression was induced with plasmid transfection by Lipofectamine().
      The effect of tankyrase 1 overexpression on proliferation, autophagy and
      mTOR pathway in 24-month-old ED rats' CSMCs was measured by the cell
      growth curve in MTT assay, cell cycle analysis in flow cytometry (FCM),
      key protein expression in Western blot, autophagy quantity in transmission
      electron microscopy, monodansylcadaverine staining and GFP-LC3
      fluorescence. The primary CSMCs were confirmed by immunofluorescence, and
      the purity was 99.1% in FCM. Compared with that of 8-month-old rats,
      tankyrase 1 expression and autophagy quantity significantly decreased in
      24-month-old ED rats' primary CSMCs (P &lt; 0.01). Tankyrase 1 overexpression
      significantly increased the growth rate (P &lt; 0.05) and increased the S
      phase of cell cycle (P &lt; 0.01). The autophagosome quantity was remarkably
      increased (P &lt; 0.01), LC3-I/II and Beclin 1 were upregulated (P &lt; 0.01 and
      P &lt; 0.05), and p-p70S6K (Thr389) was downregulated in 24-month-old ED rat
      CSMCs (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, Tankyrase 1 and autophagy decrease in the
      CSMCs from aging rats with ED, and tankyrase 1 may have a positive effect
      on proliferation by enhancing autophagy and regulating the mTOR signalling
      pathway.

TI  - S6K1 is a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2 that connects nutrient status and
      DNA damage response.
AB  - p53 mediates DNA damage-induced cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or
      senescence, and it is controlled by Mdm2, which mainly ubiquitinates p53
      in the nucleus and promotes p53 nuclear export and degradation. By
      searching for the kinases responsible for Mdm2 S163 phosphorylation under
      genotoxic stress, we identified S6K1 as a multifaceted regulator of Mdm2.
      DNA damage activates mTOR-S6K1 through p38alpha MAPK. The activated S6K1
      forms a tighter complex with Mdm2, inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53
      ubiquitination, and promotes p53 induction, in addition to phosphorylating
      Mdm2 on S163. Deactivation of mTOR-S6K1 signalling leads to Mdm2 nuclear
      translocation, which is facilitated by S163 phosphorylation, a reduction
      in p53 induction, and an alteration in p53-dependent cell death. These
      findings thus establish mTOR-S6K1 as a novel regulator of p53 in DNA
      damage response and likely in tumorigenesis. S6K1-Mdm2 interaction
      presents a route for cells to incorporate the metabolic/energy cues into
      DNA damage response and links the aging-controlling Mdm2-p53 and mTOR-S6K
      pathways.

TI  - Regulation of mitochondrial phospholipids by Ups1/PRELI-like proteins
      depends on proteolysis and Mdm35.
AB  - The mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism critically depends on members of
      the conserved Ups1/PRELI-like protein family in the intermembrane space.
      Ups1 and Ups2 (also termed Gep1) were shown to regulate the accumulation
      of cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), respectively, in a
      lipid-specific but coordinated manner. It remained enigmatic, however, how
      the relative abundance of both phospholipids in mitochondrial membranes is
      adjusted on the molecular level. Here, we describe a novel regulatory
      circuit determining the accumulation of Ups1 and Ups2 in the intermembrane
      space. Ups1 and Ups2 are intrinsically unstable proteins, which are
      degraded by distinct mitochondrial peptidases. The turnover of Ups2 is
      mediated by the i-AAA protease Yme1, whereas Ups1 is degraded by both Yme1
      and the metallopeptidase Atp23. We identified Mdm35, a member of the twin
      Cx(9)C protein family, as a novel interaction partner of Ups1 and Ups2.
      Binding to Mdm35 ensures import and protects both proteins against
      proteolysis. Homologues to all components of this pathway are present in
      higher eukaryotes, suggesting that the regulation of mitochondrial CL and
      PE levels is conserved in evolution.

      mechanism of an Er-Xian Decoction on osteoblastic UMR-106 and osteoclasts
      induced from RAW264.7.
PG  - 4695-710
AB  - Er-Xian Decoction (EXD) has been used for the treatment of osteoporosis
      disorders, menopausal syndrome, and other aging diseases in the Chinese
      traditional healthcare system. However, the targets and mechanism of
      action have not been clarified. This study was designed to investigate the
      effects and possible target proteins of EXD on osteoblastic UMR-106 cells
      and osteoclasts induced from RAW264.7 cells using the proteomic analysis
      technique. We found that EXD at a concentration of 50-200 microg/mL
      significantly enhanced osteoblastic UMR-106 cell proliferation, alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) activity and formation of bone nodules, and decreased
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and the bone
      resorption action of osteoclasts induced from RAW 264.7 cells. In
      EXD-treated osteoblasts, there were increases in the expression of
      heat-shock protein 1, high mobility group protein (Hmgb1), acidic
      ribosomal phosphoprotein P0, histone 2, carbonyl reductase 1, ATP
      synthase, aldolase A, and Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI)-alpha; and
      reduction in the expression of carbonic anhydrase 3, prohibitin,
      hemiferrin, far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein. In EXD-treated
      osteoclasts, there were increases in the expression of vimentin, protein
      disulfide isomerase associated 3 and alpha-fetoprotein; and reduction in
      the expression of calnexin. These results indicated that EXD modulates
      bone metabolism through regulation of osteoblastic proliferation,
      apoptosis, and cell activation, and osteoclastic protein folding and
      aggregation.

TI  - Conceptual and methodological issues relevant to cytokine and inflammatory
      marker measurements in clinical research.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide clinical investigators with an understanding
      of factors to consider when wishing to add cytokine and inflammatory
      marker measurements to their studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Inflammation
      involves complex and coordinated responses of the immune system to tissue
      damage. In the absence of tools to routinely assess inflammation within
      living tissues, measurements of humoral factors such as cytokines and
      other inflammatory mediators or markers can provide predictive clinical
      information and insights into disease mechanisms. Historically,
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) became the gold standard, yet
      this approach of measuring a single protein in each sample limits the
      amount of information which can be obtained from limited amounts of human
      sample. In recent years, commercially available multiplex technologies
      which detect large numbers of proteins in a limited volume have provided
      investigators with opportunities to begin addressing the complexity of
      inflammatory responses. Nevertheless, great attention needs to be paid to
      many aspects of study design, sample collection, sample measurement and
      data analysis. These considerations are especially significant when using
      technologies for which experience remains limited. SUMMARY: Whereas
      measurements of peripheral levels of inflammatory markers can add
      important mechanistic elements to human subject research, careful
      attention to conceptual and methodological considerations is essential,
      especially when using novel technologies.

TI  - Werner's syndrome as a hereditary risk factor for exocrine pancreatic
      cancer: Potential role of WRN in pancreatic tumorigenesis and
      patient-tailored therapy.
AB  - Advanced age is considered a risk factor of pancreatic cancer, but this
      relationship at the molecular and genetic level remains unclear. We
      present a clinical case series focusing on an association between
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma and Werner's syndrome (WS) that is an autosomal
      recessive genetic disorder characterized by accelerated aging and cancer
      predisposition, and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the WS RecQ
      helicase gene (WRN). Although pancreatic adenocarcinoma mostly occurs in a
      sporadic fashion, a minority of cases occurs in the context of susceptible
      individuals with hereditary syndromes. While WS has not been previously
      recognized as a risk factor for developing malignant tumors of the
      exocrine pancreas, the clinicopathologic features of three reported
      patients suggest a contributory role of WRN deficiency in pancreatic
      carcinogenesis. Molecular genetic analyses support the role of WRN as a
      tumor suppressor gene, although recent evidence reveals that WRN can
      alternatively promote oncogenicity depending on the molecular context.
      Based upon the clinico-pathologic features of these patients and the role
      of WRN in experimental models, we propose that its loss-of-function
      predisposes the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma through
      epigenetic silencing or loss-of-heterozygosity of WRN. To test this
      hypothesis, we are investigating the mechanistic role of WRN in pancreatic
      cancer models including a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line generated
      from a human with WS. These studies are expected to provide new insight
      into the relationship between aging and pancreatic tumorigenesis, and
      facilitate development of novel strategies for patient-tailored
      interventions in this deadly malignancy.

TI  - A Case Study for Outreach: The Auckland Experience of the New Zealand
      Brain Bee Challenge.
AB  - The 3rd hosting of the Auckland region New Zealand Brain Bee Challenge was
      held in 2009. Designed as a neuroscience quiz for high school students,
      the competition provides a valuable case study for science outreach. By
      engaging with teenagers, the field of neuroscience presents an exciting
      area of science but also stimulates those in the field to promote and
      share their research. Neuroscience is the ideal subject to highlight and
      promote science to young people and the community, as the brain defines
      unique features such as our personality, emotions, creativity, and
      intelligence. Understanding brain function and, importantly, determining
      dysfunction is a growing area of research interest, with relevance to
      health care systems and government policy, especially in light of the
      aging population. Feedback from students and teachers indicated that they
      had learned something about research and the brain, were more aware of
      options within science including considering neuroscience as a career
      option, and would recommend participation in the Brain Bee Challenge to
      other students. A number of participants indicated it was
      interesting/valuable to have interaction with neuroscientists. Although
      there are many synergistic benefits resulting from an undertaking such as
      the Brain Bee Challenge, the following profile highlights the value of the
      interaction and promotion of research to the community.

TI  - Comparison of tenderness, palatability, and retail caselife of enhanced
      cow subprimals to non-enhanced cow and USDA Select subprimals.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of enhancing cow
      subprimals on tenderness, palatability, and retail case life compared to
      non-enhanced cow and USDA Select subprimals. Strip loin, top sirloin butt,
      and ribeye subprimals were selected (n = 60 per subprimal; n = 40 cow, n =
      20 USDA Select). At 14 d postmortem, half of the cow product was randomly
      selected for enhancement with phosphate, salt, rosemary, potassium
      lactate, beef stock, ice, and water using a needle injector. All
      subprimals were fabricated on d 14 postmortem into 10-2.54 cm steaks.
      Steaks were assigned to analysis for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF),
      trained sensory panel evaluation, or simulated retail display and assigned
      randomly to aging periods of 14, 21, or 28 d postmortem. Warner-Bratzler
      shear force values of ribeye steaks from the non-enhanced cow over all
      aging groups were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than enhanced cow and
      USDA Select ribeyes. Furthermore, top sirloin butts from non-enhanced cow
      were had greater (P &lt; 0.05) WBSF values at 14 and 28 d compared to other
      treatments. Non-enhanced cow strip loin steaks had higher (P &lt; 0.05) WBSF
      values (4.58 +/- 0.15 kg) and greater (P &lt; 0.05) cook loss (20.70 +/- 0.68
      kg) than enhanced cow (3.90 +/- 0.14 kg; 14.32 +/- 0.69 kg) and USDA
      Select steaks (3.09 +/- 0.14 kg; 15.01 +/- 0.68 kg). Sensory data revealed
      that enhanced cow steaks from all subprimals were higher (P &lt; 0.05) for
      initial juiciness for both aging periods, compared to non-enhanced cow and
      USDA Select. Sensory tenderness ratings for enhanced cow and USDA Select
      subprimals were higher (P &lt; 0.05) than non-enhanced subprimals.
      Non-enhanced subprimals received the highest connective tissue amount
      score by panelists (P &lt; 0.05). Enhanced cow steaks from all three
      subprimals had a greater intensity (P &lt; 0.05) for salty flavor. Panelists
      detected a more intense (P &lt; 0.05) soapy flavor in enhanced ribeyes. In
      ribeye and top sirloin butt steaks, grassy/cowy flavor was more intense (P
      &lt; 0.05) in non-enhanced cow steaks compared to enhanced and Select.
      Subjective color scores revealed USDA Select ribeye and strip loin steaks
      aged 14 d were darker red (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to 21 and 28 d aged
      steaks. Non-enhanced cow steaks from all three subprimals had the greatest
      amount (P &lt; 0.05) of surface discoloration during display. Enhanced cow
      strip loins had the lowest (P &lt; 0.05) L* and b* values over all aging
      periods, while USDA Select strip loins at 28 d had the lowest (P &lt; 0.05)
      a* value. The USDA Select top sirloin butt steaks had the highest (P &lt;
      0.05) b* value over all aging periods. Enhanced cow steaks were comparable
      or superior to USDA Select steaks for tenderness and juiciness, but
      additional research is needed to determine consumer acceptability of
      additional flavors associated with enhancement of cow product and to
      improve the effects of enhancement on color of cow product.

TI  - Intraoperative Hemodynamic Instability During and After Separation From
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass.
AB  - Every year, more than 1 million patients worldwide undergo cardiac
      surgery. Because of the aging of the population, cardiac surgery will
      increasingly be offered to patients at a higher risk of complications. The
      consequence is a reduced physiological reserve and hence an increased risk
      of mortality. These issues will have a significant impact on future health
      care costs because the population undergoing cardiac surgery will be older
      and more likely to develop postoperative complications. One of the most
      dreaded complications in cardiac surgery is difficult separation from
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). When separation from CPB is associated with
      right-ventricular failure, the mortality rate will range from 44% to 86%.
      Therefore, the diagnosis and the preoperative prediction of difficult
      separation from CPB will be crucial to improve the selection and care of
      patients and to prevent complications for this high-risk patient
      population.

TI  - Fatigue and fatigability in older adults.
PG  - 406-13
AB  - Fatigue is believed to be a common complaint among older adults; however,
      multiple studies of self-reported fatigue across the lifespan have found
      this may not be the case. To explain this paradox, this article considers
      "fatigability"-a phenotype characterized by the relationship between an
      individual's perceived fatigue and the activity level with which the
      fatigue is associated. Fatigability may be measured by combining
      self-report measures of fatigue with performance of physical or cognitive
      activities, provided that the work of the activity is known or can be
      standardized. Doing so prevents self-pacing and allows meaningful
      comparisons across subjects and between studies. Increased fatigability
      with aging may arise from a variety of factors including age-related
      changes in energy production or utilization, and inflammatory mechanisms.
      A few published intervention studies have targeted fatigue in older
      adults, though none have examined fatigability specifically. Because
      fatigue may represent a physiologic warning system, future clinical
      studies may benefit from a focus on fatigability, where both symptoms and
      function are considered.

TI  - Ultrastructure of the myotendinous junction of the medial pterygoid muscle
      of adult and aged Wistar rats.
AB  - The myotendon junction (MTJ) is a specialised area into the muscle fibers
      where the sarcoplasmic membranes connect to the collagen fibers bundles.
      There are few data about plasticity of the MTJ in aging processes. The aim
      of this study is to analyse the ultrastructure characteristics of MTJ of
      medial pterygoid muscle of adult and aged rats. Employing the transmission
      electron microscopy method, twenty male rats Wistar (Rattus norvegicus)
      were divided into two groups: A (n=10) with 12 months of age; B (n=10) 24
      months of age. The animals were anaesthetised with overdose the urethane
      (3g/kg, i.p.) and sacrified during the perfusion with modified Karnovsky
      solution. The specimens were post-fixed in a 1% osmium tetroxide solution,
      dehydrated in ascending concentration of ethanol and embedded in Spurr
      resin. The thin sections, of 90nm thick, were counterstained with uranyl
      acetate and lead citrate solution, and examined in a Jeol 1010
      transmission electron microscope. The fine structure of the MTJ of group A
      revealed the defined interdigitations and disposed in several levels of
      deep formations containing the collagen fibers. In the group B, such
      structures did not observed, detecting the projections irregular in shape,
      and large of extra matrix with in aspect of remodelling. In conclusion it
      was possible to identify the plasticity of MTJ in the group B which
      presented several morphological alterations comparing to the adult
      animals. These data of group B suggested the occurrence of aging processes
      in the MTJ in rats.

TI  - Combination of conjugated linoleic acid with fish oil prevents
      age-associated bone marrow adiposity in C57Bl/6J mice.
AB  - The inverse relationship between fat in bone marrow and bone mass in the
      skeleton of aging subjects is well known. However, there is no precise
      therapy for the treatment of bone marrow adiposity. We investigated the
      ability of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and fish oil (FO), alone or in
      combination, to modulate bone loss using 12 months old C57Bl/6J mice fed
      10% corn oil diet as control or supplemented with 0.5% CLA or 5% FO or
      0.5% CLA+5% FO for 6 months. We found, CLA-fed mice exhibited reduced body
      weight, body fat mass (BFM) and enhanced hind leg lean mass (HLLM) and
      bone mineral density (BMD) in different regions measured by dual energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); however, associated with fatty liver and
      increased insulin resistance; whereas, FO fed mice exhibited enhanced BMD,
      improved insulin sensitivity, with no changes in BFM and HLLM.
      Interestingly, CLA+FO fed mice exhibited reduced body weight, BFM,
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and cathepsin K
      expression in bone marrow with enhanced BMD and HLLM. Moreover, CLA+FO
      supplementation reduced liver hypertrophy and improved insulin sensitivity
      with remarkable attenuation of bone marrow adiposity, inflammation and
      oxidative stress in aging mice. Therefore, CLA with FO combination might
      be a novel dietary supplement to reduce fat mass and improve BMD.

TI  - Telomere biology in Metazoa.
AB  - In this review we present critical overview of some of the available
      literature on the fundamental biology of telomeres and telomerase in
      Metazoan. With the exception of Nematodes and Arthropods, the (TTAGGG)(n)
      sequence is conserved in most Metazoa. Available data show that
      telomerase-based end maintenance is a very ancient mechanism in
      unicellular and multicellular organisms. In invertebrates, fish,
      amphibian, and reptiles persistent telomerase activity in somatic tissues
      might allow the maintenance of the extensive regenerative potentials of
      these species. Telomerase repression among birds and many mammals suggests
      that, as humans, they may use replicative aging as a tumor protection
      mechanism.

TI  - Flufenamic acid modulates multiple currents in gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone neurons.
AB  - Reproduction in mammals is dependent upon the appropriate neurosecretion
      of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), yet the endogenous generation of
      activity underlying GnRH secretion remains poorly understood. We have
      demonstrated that the depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), which modulates
      bursting activity, is reduced in isolated GnRH neurons from aged animals.
      Calcium-activated non-specific cation (CAN) channels contribute to the DAP
      in other vertebrate neurosecretory cells. We used the CAN channel blocker
      flufenamic acid (FFA) to examine the contribution of CAN channels to the
      DAP in GnRH neurons during aging. Recordings were performed on isolated
      fluorescent GnRH neurons from young, middle-aged and aged female mice.
      Flufenamic acid inhibited spontaneous activity, but significantly
      increased the DAP in neurons from young and middle-aged animals. Apamin
      did not significantly potentiate the DAP, but did reduce the effects of
      FFA, suggesting that the increased DAP is partially due to blockade of
      apamin-sensitive SK channels. Flufenamic acid increased the current
      underlying the DAP (I(ADP)) and decreased the preceding fast outward
      current (I(OUT)) at all ages. These current responses were not affected by
      apamin, but TEA evoked similar changes. Thus, a potassium current, likely
      mediated through BK channels, contributes to the fast AHP and appears to
      offset the DAP; this current is sensitive to FFA, but insensitive to age.
      The effect of FFA on the DAP, but not I(ADP), is diminished in aged
      animals, possibly reflecting an age-related modulation of the
      apamin-sensitive SK channel. Future studies will examine the expression of
      SK channels during the aging process in GnRH neurons.

TI  - Independent influence of gait speed and step length on stability and fall
      risk.
AB  - With aging, individuals' gaits become slower and their steps shorter; both
      are thought to improve stability against balance threats. Recent studies
      have shown that shorter step lengths, which bring the center of mass (COM)
      closer to the leading foot, improve stability against slip-related falls.
      However, a slower gait, hence lower COM velocity, does the opposite. Due
      to the inherent coupling of step length and speed in spontaneous gait, the
      extent to which the benefit of shorter steps can offset the slower speed
      is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate, through
      decoupling, the independent effects of gait speed and step length on gait
      stability and the likelihood of slip-induced falls. Fifty-seven young
      adults walked at one of three target gait patterns, two of equal speed and
      two of equal step length; at a later trial, they encountered an
      unannounced slip. The results supported our hypotheses that faster gait as
      well as shorter steps each ameliorates fall risk when a slip is
      encountered. This appeared to be attributable to the maintenance of
      stability from slip initiation to liftoff of the recovery foot during the
      slip. Successful decoupling of gait speed from step length reveals for the
      first time that, although slow gait in itself leads to instability and
      falls (a one-standard-deviation decrease in gait speed increases the odds
      of fall by 4-fold), this effect is offset by the related decrease in step
      length (the same one-standard-deviation decrease in step length lowers
      fall risk by 6 times).

TI  - Influence of relative humidity on the interaction between different aryl
      propionic acid derivatives and poly(vinylpyrrolydone) k30. Evaluation of
      the effect on drug bioavailability.
AB  - The present work assessed the physical interactions between several aryl
      propionic acid derivatives and polyvinyl(pyrrolidone) K30 (PVP), stored
      together at 298+/-0.5K at different relative humidities (RH 55, 75 and
      86%). Results were compared to those obtained at low RH (22%), published
      in a previous paper. The water uptake percentage of binary mixtures were
      intermediate between that of pure PVP and pure drugs. By X-ray powder
      diffraction, for all the drugs, it was possible to note a marked decrease
      in crystallinity degree, in particular at highest RH%. The loss in
      crystallinity degree may be considered an evidence of the physicochemical
      interaction between the polymer and the drug, supporting the formation of
      a solid dispersion. By high-resolution (1)H solid state NMR spectrometry,
      it was possible to observe an increase of drug-polymer interaction with
      aging, with the only exception of ibuprofen. Molecular docking proved the
      establishment of Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions for all the
      mixtures, and for mixtures with fenbufen and naproxen, also hydrogen
      bonds. The application of Gordon-Taylor rule to the thermal analysis
      revealed that the requirement of volume additivity of this rule was not
      fulfilled for any mixture, and a negative deviation from theoretical
      behavior was always observed. The hydration of drug-PVP mixtures had
      important repercussion on drug solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate
      (IDR). In general, an increase in water solubility and consequently an
      increase in IDR was observed, with few exceptions, at highest RH%.

TI  - Prefrontal Cortex, Caloric Restriction And Stress During Aging: Studies On
      Dopamine And Acetylcholine Release, Bdnf And Working Memory.
AB  - This study was designed to investigate whether long-term caloric
      restriction during the life span of the rat changes the effects of an
      acute mild stress on the release of dopamine and acetylcholine in the
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) and on working memory performance. Spontaneous
      motor activity was also monitored and levels of BDNF measured in the
      prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Male Wistar rats (3 months of
      age) were housed during 3, 12, 21 and 27 months (6, 15, 24 and 30 months
      of age at the end of housing) in caloric restriction (CR; 40% food intake
      restriction) or control conditions. After behavioural testing, animals
      were further subdivided into two other groups. In one of the groups BDNF
      protein levels were determined. In the other group rats were implanted
      with guide cannulas into the PFC to perform microdialysis experiments. In
      CR rats the release of dopamine produced by handling stress did not differ
      from the response found in control rats of 6, 15 and 24 months of age. The
      release of acetylcholine was not changed at the ages of 6 and 15 months
      but reduced at the age of 24 months. Stress did not change dopamine or
      acetylcholine release in CR and control rats of 30 months of age. BDNF
      levels were increased in the hippocampus and amygdala, but not in the PFC,
      of 6 and 15 months CR rats. Spontaneous motor activity was increased in
      all groups of CR rats. Age, however, decreased motor activity in CR and
      control rats. Both experimental groups showed similar working memory
      performance in a delayed alternation task in basal conditions and after a
      situation of acute stress. These results suggest that CR does not modify
      the function of the PFC in response to an acute stress nor the changes
      found as a result of the normal process of aging.

TI  - Signaling pathways in mitochondrial dysfunction and aging.
AB  - Mitochondria are central players in the determination of cell life and
      death. They are essential for energy production, since most cellular ATP
      is produced in their matrix by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. At
      the same time, mitochondria are the main regulators of apoptotic cell
      death, mediating both extrinsic (cell-surface receptor mediated) and
      intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate as
      side products of the electron transport chain, causing mitochondrial
      damage. Non-functional mitochondria accumulate in aged individuals, and
      cell homeostasis is maintained by removing damaged mitochondria by an
      autophagic process called "mitophagy". In addition, mitochondrial ROS
      represent signaling molecules leading to autophagy, consisting in the bulk
      degradation of cytosolic portions. When cell homeostasis is perturbed, and
      cytosolic components are damaged, autophagy represents a defense mechanism
      aimed at removing non-functional proteins and organelles. If this is not
      sufficient, cell death occurs with distinct morphological hallmarks from
      apoptosis. This binary choice integrates a number of critical information
      converging on a number of common regulatory elements. In this review, the
      focus will be placed on the central role of mitochondria in the cross-talk
      between autophagy and apoptosis, highlighting the signaling pathways and
      molecular machinery impinging on these organelles.

TI  - Chocolate consumption is inversely associated with calcified
      atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries: The NHLBI Family Heart
      Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: While a diet rich in anti-oxidant has been favorably
      associated with coronary disease and hypertension, limited data have
      evaluated the influence of such diet on subclinical disease. Thus, we
      sought to examine whether chocolate consumption is associated with
      calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries (CAC). METHODS:
      In a cross-sectional design, we studied 2217 participants of the NHLBI
      Family Heart Study. Chocolate consumption was assessed by a
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and CAC was measured by
      cardiac CT. We defined prevalent CAC using an Agatston score of at least
      100 and fitted generalized estimating equations to calculate prevalence
      odds ratios of CAC. RESULTS: There was an inverse association between
      frequency of chocolate consumption and prevalent CAC. Odds ratios (95% CI)
      for CAC were 1.0 (reference), 0.94 (0.66-1.35), 0.78 (0.53-1.13), and 0.68
      (0.48-0.97) for chocolate consumption of 0, 1-3 times per month, once per
      week, and 2+ times per week, respectively (p for trend 0.022), adjusting
      for age, sex, energy intake, waist-hip ratio, education, smoking, alcohol
      consumption, ratio of total-to-HDL-cholesterol, non-chocolate candy, and
      diabetes mellitus. Controlling for additional confounders did not alter
      the findings. Exclusion of subjects with coronary heart disease or
      diabetes mellitus did not materially change the odds ratio estimates but
      did modestly decrease the overall significance (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS:
      These data suggest that chocolate consumption might be inversely
      associated with prevalent CAC.

TI  - Effect of air-abrasion on the retention of zirconia ceramic crowns luted
      with different cements before and after artificial aging.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect
      of intaglio surface air-abrasion on the retention of CAD/CAM produced
      zirconia ceramic crowns cemented with three different types of cement. In
      addition the influence of artificial aging in masticatory simulator and
      thermocycling was tested. METHODS: Extracted human premolars were prepared
      for all-ceramic crowns (12 degrees taper, 3mm axial length). CAD/CAM
      zirconia crowns were manufactured. Half of the crowns were air-abraded
      with 50mum alumina particles at 0.25MPa, the rest was left as machined.
      The crowns were luted with zinc phosphate cement (Hoffmann), glass ionomer
      cement (Ketac Cem), or composite resin (Panavia 21), subgroups were either
      stored for 3 days in 37 degrees water bath or stored for 150 days in 37
      degrees water bath, with additional 37,500 thermal cycles (5-55 degrees )
      and 300,000 cycles dynamic loading with 5kg in a masticatory simulator.
      Then crown retention was measured in tension at a crosshead speed of
      2mm/min using a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was
      performed with three-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Mean retention values were ranged
      from 2.8 to 7.1MPa after 3 days and from 1.6 to 6.1MPa after artificial
      aging. Air-abrasion significantly increased crown retention (p&lt;0.001),
      while artificial aging decreased retention (p=0.017). In addition, the
      luting material had a significant influence on retention (p&lt;0.001) with
      the adhesive luting resin providing the highest retention. SIGNIFICANCE:
      The use of phosphate monomer containing composite resin on air-abraded
      zirconia ceramic can be recommended as most retentive luting method.

TI  - Effect of pretest storage conditions of extracted teeth on their dentin
      bond strengths.
PG  - 92-97
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain
      sufficient freshly extracted human teeth to utilize in in vitro studies,
      particularly for bonding investigations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
      study was to investigate the effect of different storage conditions for
      human extracted teeth prior to their use in microtensile bond strength
      (muTBS) testing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty incisors were divided into
      groups according to their storage time and condition. The first group
      consisted of freshly extracted teeth. Teeth of the second group were
      stored in chloramine-T at 4 degrees C for 2 years +/-1 month. The last
      group was stored dry for up to 2 years +/-2 months, after which teeth were
      rehydrated in distilled water for 2 weeks before use. All teeth were
      disinfected using 0.5% chloramine-T. Dentin surfaces were exposed and then
      bonded using Scotchbond Multi-Purpose or Clearfil SE Bond to composite
      resin foundations (Esthet-X). Following 24-hour storage, bonded teeth
      (n=30) were sectioned into beams with a cross-section of 0.9 +/-0.1 mm(2)
      and subjected to muTBS testing using a microtensile testing machine (Micro
      Tensile Tester). Data were calculated and statistically analyzed using
      Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (alpha=.05). Failure modes were
      determined using a stereomicroscope at x40 magnification. RESULTS:
      Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the
      different storage conditions nor between the 2 adhesive systems for each
      storage condition (P&gt;.05). Modes of failure for all tested groups were
      predominantly adhesive followed by mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      limitations of this study, it was concluded that aging of teeth and
      storage conditions had no significant effect on dentin microtensile bond
      strength to composite resin.

TI  - [Incidence and distributing feature of chronic heart failure in adult
      population of Xinjiang.]
PG  - 460-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and distributing feature of
      chronic heart failure (CHF) in adult population of Xinjiang. METHODS:
      Four-stage random sampling method was used to analyze the prevalence and
      distributing feature of self-reported congestive heart failure among
      different nationalities in adult (35 years and over) population of
      Xinjiang. Sampling was collected from 6 localities (Urumqi, Kelamayi,
      Fukang, Turfan Basin, Hetian, Yili Hazakh). RESULTS: A total of 8459
      adults were surveyed. The prevalence of CHF was 1.26% in this cohort. The
      prevalence of CHF was 0.89%, 1.11% and 2.14%(*) in Han, Uygur and Hazakh
      population, respectively ((*)P &lt; 0.05 vs. Han and Uygur). The risk of CHF
      was higher in the males than in the females (1.61% vs. 0.93%, u = 2.79, P
      &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of CHF increased in proportion with aging and was
      0.29%, 0.60%, 1.32%, 2.55% and 4.10% in 35 - 44, 45 - 54, 55 - 64, 65 -
      74, 75 years and over age groups, respectively. Common complications of
      CHF were hypertension (63.55%), coronary heart disease (42.99%), diabetes
      (18.69%), valvular heart disease (5.61%) and atrial fibrillation (4.67%).
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CHF in Xinjiang was higher than the average
      level in China (0.9%) and was the highest in the Hazakh population.

TI  - [Pathology of myocardial fatty infiltration: an autopsy report from 117
      cases]
PG  - 350-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors related to the formation of
      myocardial fatty infiltration and possible pathological consequences.
      METHODS: The macroscopic and microscopic findings in 117 autopsy cases
      with myocardial fatty infiltration were examined during October, 2001 to
      June, 2009. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between
      the macroscopic grading of subepicardial adipose tissue and the
      microscopic myocardial fatty infiltrative degree(r(s) = 0.57, P &lt; 0.01)
      but there was no correlations between the myocardial fatty infiltrative
      degree and age as well as coronary arteriosclerosis (all P &gt; 0.05). The
      percent of myocardial atrophy was 39.32% (46/117), and the rate of
      myocardial atrophy in mild myocardial fatty infiltration group (13/63,
      20.63%) was significantly lower than that in moderate myocardial fatty
      infiltration group (22/39, 34.92%; chi(2) = 12.14, P &lt; 0.01) and in severe
      myocardial fatty infiltration group (11/15, 73.33%; chi(2) = 13.42, P &lt;
      0.01). There were 28 sudden cardiac deaths among the 117 cases including 6
      deaths due to myocardial fatty infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial fatty
      infiltration is often associated with myocardial atrophy, even with sudden
      cardiac death but is not an accompanying pathologic changes of aging and
      coronary arteriosclerosis.

TI  - A Controlled Trial of an Intervention to Improve Urinary and Fecal
      Incontinence and Constipation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effects of a multicomponent intervention on fecal
      incontinence (FI) and urinary incontinence (UI) outcomes. DESIGN:
      Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Six nursing homes (NHs).
      PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twelve NH residents. INTERVENTION: Intervention
      subjects were offered toileting assistance, exercise, and choice of food
      and fluid snacks every 2 hours for 8 hours per day over 3 months.
      MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of UI and FI and rate of appropriate toileting as
      determined by direct checks from research staff. Anorectal assessments
      were completed on a subset of 29 residents. RESULTS: The intervention
      significantly increased physical activity, frequency of toileting, and
      food and fluid intake. UI improved (P=.049), as did frequency of bowel
      movements (P&lt;.001) and percentage of bowel movements (P&lt;.001) in the
      toilet. The frequency of FI did not change. Eighty-nine percent of
      subjects who underwent anorectal testing showed a dyssynergic voiding
      pattern, which could explain the lack of efficacy of this intervention
      program alone on FI. CONCLUSION: This multicomponent intervention
      significantly changed multiple risk factors associated with FI and
      increased bowel movements without decreasing FI. The dyssynergic voiding
      pattern and rectal hyposensitivity suggest that future interventions may
      have to be supplemented with bulking agents (fiber), biofeedback therapy,
      or both to improve bowel function.

TI  - Partial restoration of T cell function in aged mice by in vitro blockade
      of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.
AB  - Summary Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a newly characterized negative
      regulator of immune responses. The interaction of PD-1 with its ligands
      (PD-L1 and PD-L2) inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production in
      young mice. Increased PD-1 expression has been described during chronic
      infections, inducing chronic activation of the immune system to control
      it. As aging is associated with chronic immune activation, PD-1 may
      contribute to age-associated T cell dysfunction. Our data showed that in
      aged mice: (i) the number of PD-1-expressing T cells and the level of
      expression of PD-Ls was increased on dendritic cell subsets and T cells;
      (ii) PD-1(+) T cells were exhausted effector memory T cells, as shown by
      their lower level of CD127, CD25 and CD28, as well as their limited
      proliferative and cytokine producing capacity; (iii) the expression of
      PD-1 was up-regulated after TCR-mediated activation of CD8(+) T cells, but
      not of CD4(+) T cells; (iv) blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway moderately
      improved the cytokine production of T cells from old mice but did not
      restore their proliferation; and (v) blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
      did not restore function of PD-1(+) T cells; its effect appeared to be
      exclusively mediated by increased functionality of the PD-1(-) T cells.
      Our data thus suggest that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 is not likely to be
      efficient at restoring exhausted T cell responses in aged hosts, although
      improving the responses of PD-1(-) T cells may prove to be a helpful
      strategy in enhancing primary responses.

TI  - Myogenic and proteolytic mRNA expression following blood flow restricted
      exercise.
AB  - ABSTRACT Aim: Resistance exercise performed at low loads (20-30% of
      maximal strength) with blood flow restriction (BFR) acutely increases
      protein synthesis and induces hypertrophy when performed chronically. We
      investigated myogenic and proteolytic mRNA expression 8 hrs following an
      acute bout of knee extension exercise Methods: Fifteen subjects (22.8 +/-
      3.7 yrs, 8 men and 7 women) were randomized to two exercise conditions:
      BFR or control exercise. All participants performed 4 sets of exercise
      (30, 15, 15 &amp; 15 repetitions) at 20% of maximal strength. Persons in the
      BFR group had a cuff placed on the upper thigh inflated to 1.5 times
      brachial systolic blood pressure (cuff pressure range: 135-186 mmHg).
      Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were excised 24 hrs before and 8
      hrs following the exercise. Results: RT-PCR analysis demonstrated no
      change in myogenic gene expression (IGF-1, MyoD, Myogenin, Myostatin - a
      negative regulator) with either exercise condition (p &gt; 0.123). However,
      BFR exercise downregulated mRNA expression in transcripts associated with
      proteolytic pathways (FOXO3A, Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1) with no change in the
      control exercise condition. Specifically, median mRNA expression of FOXO3A
      decreased by 1.92 fold (p = 0.01), Atrogin-1 by 2.10 fold (p = 0.01) and
      MuRF-1 by 2.44 fold (p = 0.01). Conclusion: These data are consistent with
      the downregulation of proteolytic transcripts observed following high load
      resistance exercise. In summary, myogenic genes are unchanged and
      proteolytic genes associated with muscle remodeling are reduced 8 hours
      following low load BFR exercise.

TI  - Green tea extract-patents and diversity of uses.
PG  - 203-15
AB  - Green tea is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. Presently,
      Camellia sinensis has become a source not only for the development of
      several food extracts but also nutraceutical, cosmetic and medicinal
      purposes. The technology developed to produce these extracts aims to
      improve the organoleptic characteristics of the products as taste and
      smell, and their shelf life. But it also searches to demonstrate some
      medicinal attributes like antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-tumor and
      anti-viral activities in relation to the chemical composition of the green
      tea catechins, especially (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The target
      of this review is to present the various patents related to the extraction
      methods and their claims, and to discuss the evidence found in the
      literature about the pharmacological activities of green tea. It
      summarizes the recent progress in technology to obtain the green tea
      extract and in clinical studies on its applications. Health-promoting
      products and disease-preventing applications of green tea extract or
      compounds isolated from it also take part of this text.

TI  - The licensed practical nurse workforce in the United States: one state's
      experience.
PG  - 179-212
AB  - BACKGROUND: Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) are employed in multiple
      health care settings in the United States, with the largest portion
      providing nursing care in long-term care, skilled nursing, and nursing
      home facilities, which largely provide custodial care and rehabilitative
      services to elderly residents. Rapid growth in the size of the elderly
      population in the U.S., combined with retirements from an aging LPN
      workforce, are expected to increase the demand for LPNs in the coming
      decades. This paper describes the characteristics of LPNs in one state,
      Washington, and makes projections of LPN supply and demand in the state
      through 2026. METHODS: The study uses data from a 2007 survey of LPNs with
      Washington State licenses to describe the demographic, education, and
      practice characteristics of the workforce. The projections of LPN supply
      and demand were built from the baseline survey data and changes over time
      were estimated using available data and literature from a variety of
      sources. RESULTS: Of the 14,446 LPNs with Washington licenses in 2007, 72%
      practiced in the state. The work setting in which the largest percentage
      worked was long-term care (37%). Of the average 37 hours worked per week
      by LPNs, 25 hours were spent in direct patient care. The average age of
      practicing LPNs was 46 and 12% of LPNs were male. The racial/ethnic
      distribution of Washington's LPNs resembled that of the overall state
      population, with 17% non-White and 4% Hispanic. Nearly three quarters
      obtained their LPN education within Washington. If the 2007 number of
      completions from LPN schools in Washington is sustained, the projected
      supply of practicing LPNs in 2026 will be more than 3,500 (24%) below
      estimated demand. If the current education completion number increased by
      200 LPNs (nearly 20%) in 2011, and this number was maintained through
      2026, the projected supply of practicing LPNs would increase but would
      still be 2,052 LPNs below estimated demand in 2026. Neither projection
      scenario produces enough LPNs to maintain the 2007 LPN-to-population ratio
      through 2026. CONCLUSIONS/POLICY IMPLICATIONS: It is not known precisely
      whether or how LPN workforce roles will change in the future, but the
      projected LPN shortages in Washington State mirror similar findings from
      other parts of the U.S., with major growth in projected LPN demand due to
      increases in, and aging of the state's population. The number of LPNs
      completing education programs in the state is unlikely to keep pace with
      the decline in supply from retirements unless a significant expansion of
      education programs takes place. The LPN profession is an important entry
      point into the nursing profession, and increasing the number of LPNs
      educated in-state could expand the pipeline leading to registered nurse
      (RN) careers, another nursing profession for which major shortages are
      predicted. Carefully articulated LPN-to-RN education programs could
      improve the attractiveness of the profession and increase the supply of
      LPNs.

TI  - [Comparative study on elderly and disabled subjects with various degrees
      of dementia]
PG  - 205-17
AB  - This study aims at showing the positive effects of arts therapies in
      individual and group sessions, with an aging, valid or dependent
      population, presenting symptoms of dementia or not. The improvement of
      cognition (including memory), well-being, as well as of certain medical
      problems (pain, tension...) was underlined in several studies on arts
      therapies, including especially the use of music therapeutic techniques.
      Indeed, music stimulates the emotional memory, causing the emergence of
      ancient memories, thus restoring narcissism. The well-being of
      participants is increased. Our population consists of elderly people, most
      of them suffering from dementia. They come to the workshops by themselves
      or led by their families. Music but also pictorial arts are used as a
      therapeutic mediation for one session per week during the time of
      hospitalization. This period varies depending on the condition of the
      subject. The scales used in T1 and T2 with patients suffering from
      dementia are the Echelle d'appreciation clinique en geriatrie by Bouvard &amp;
      Cottraux and the Fragebogen zur Beurteilung der Behandlung durch den
      Therapeuten (FBB-T) by Mattejat and Remschmidt. Regarding the criteria for
      external validation, a semi-structured interview is proposed to the nurses
      in T2. The scales used with valid people are the Index of Well-being by
      Campbell et al, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) by
      Zigmond and Snaith, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES), validated by
      Vallieres and Vallerand in 1990, and the Stressverarbeitungsfragebogen
      (SVF 78) by Janke et al. CDC: There was a positive effect for most seniors
      who attended the sessions: an increased well-being and a temporary
      appropriation of memories. However, given the small size and the
      heterogeneity of samples, the irregularity of attendance, the results
      cannot be generalized. More regular sessions of arts therapies would be
      favorable for a consolidation of results.

TI  - [Urothelial carcinoma with an inverted growth pattern: a report of 4
      cases]
PG  - 47-50
AB  - AIM: Urothelial (transitional cell) tumors account for about 90% of all
      bladder tumors. Their presentation varies from benign lesions that rarely
      recur to highly malignant tumors. Inverted (endophytic) growth pattern in
      urothelial carcinoma is particulary hard to distinguish from inverted
      papilloma. Morphologic criteria alone are not enough and
      immunohistochemical assesments must also be done, especially in cases of
      small size biopsy material or transurethral resections. The aim of this
      study was to accentuate the importance and ways of differentiation of this
      variable forms as their treatment and prognosis differ. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: In the period from 01.01.2008. to 30.06.2009. at Department of
      Pathology, University Hospital "Sestre milosrdnice" four patients were
      diagnosed with low-grade urothelial carcinoma with an inverted growth
      pattern. Routine histology and additional immunohistochemistry to p53,
      Ki-67 and CK 7 and 20 was performed. RESULTS: There were three male
      patients aging 37, 61 and 69 years and one female aged 46 (mean 53.3
      years). Three patients presented with painless hematuria while the last
      patient had microhaematuria as an Incidental finding. Histologically,
      tumors formed nests of atypical urothelial cells. Very few or no mitotic
      figures were observed. Invasion of lamina propria was present in three
      specimens. Immunohistochemically, positive staining to p53 and CK 20 was
      observed in all four cases and staining to CK 7 in two. Staining to CK 20
      was positive in 80%-100% of tumor cells while the number of p53 positive
      cells was between 20% and 40% in all four cases. Proliferative activity
      was assesed using Ki-67 antibody. The percentage of positively stained
      tumor cells, assesed in hot spots under high magnification (400x), was 5%,
      7%, 8% and 12% (mean 8%). CONCLUSION: Urothelial carcinoma with inverted
      growth pattern and inverted papilloma have similar morphologic features
      but their biological behaviour, treatment and prognosis are different. In
      order to avoid the urothelial carcinoma to be misdiagnosed as a benign
      papilloma, we find it very important to make additional investigations
      beside conventional histology. Immunohistochemical staining for CK 20, p53
      and Ki-67, which is positive in most carcinomas, can help us make the
      right diagnosis.

TI  - Clathrin assembly proteins AP180 and CALM in the embryonic rat brain.
PG  - 3803-18
AB  - Clathrin-coated vesicles are known to play diverse and pivotal roles in
      cells. The proper formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is dependent on,
      and highly regulated by, a large number of clathrin assembly proteins.
      These assembly proteins likely determine the functional specificity of
      clathrin-coated vesicles, and together they control a multitude of
      intracellular trafficking pathways, including those involved in embryonic
      development. In this study, we focus on two closely related clathrin
      assembly proteins, AP180 and CALM (clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid
      leukemia protein), in the developing embryonic rat brain. We find that
      AP180 begins to be expressed at embryonic day 14 (E14), but only in
      postmitotic cells that have acquired a neuronal fate. CALM, on the other
      hand, is expressed as early as E12, by both neural stem cells and
      postmitotic neurons. In vitro loss-of-function studies using RNA
      interference (RNAi) indicate that AP180 and CALM are dispensable for some
      aspects of embryonic neurogenesis but are required for the growth of
      postmitotic neurons. These results identify the developmental stage of
      AP180 and CALM expression and suggest that each protein has distinct
      functions in neural development.

TI  - Kidney Stem/Progenitor Cells: Differentiate, Sort Out or Reprogram?
AB  - End stage renal disease (ESRD) is defined as the inability of the kidneys
      to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood. ESRD progresses
      from earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and occurs when the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. CKD and ESRD
      are dramatically rising due to increasing aging population, population
      demographics and the growing rate of diabetes and
      hypertension.Identification of multipotential stem/progenitor populations
      in mammalian tissues is important for therapeutic applications and for
      understanding developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. Progenitor
      populations are ideal targets for gene therapy, cell transplantation and
      tissue engineering. The demand for kidney progenitors is increasing due to
      severe shortage of donor organs. Because dialysis and transplantation are
      currently the only successful therapies for ESRD, cell therapy offers an
      alternative approach for kidney diseases. However, this approach may be
      relevant only in earlier stages of CKD, when kidney function and histology
      are still preserved, allowing for the integration of cells and/or for
      their paracrine effects, but not when small and fibrotic end-stage kidneys
      develop. While blood and bone marrow derived stem cells hold a therapeutic
      promise, they are devoid of nephrogenic potential, emphasizing the need to
      seek kidney stem cells beyond known extra-renal sources. Moreover,
      controversies regarding the existence of a true adult kidney stem cell
      highlight the importance of studying cell-based therapies using
      pluripotent cells, progenitor cells from fetal kidney or
      de-differentiated/reprogrammed adult kidney cells.

TI  - Intracapsular Organization of Ciliary Zonules in Monkey Eyes.
AB  - Ciliary zonules are responsible for changing the curvature of a lens in
      the dioptric focus of an eye. Present established theory is based on the
      relaxation of zonular superficial fasciculi affixed to the capsular
      surface, thereby inducing the change of anterior- and posterior lens
      curvature causing spontaneous liquid movement of lens material. To achieve
      precise focusing at any distance, a more active functional organization
      should exist. The present studies were performed to determine not only the
      surface attachment but also the intracapsular affix of zonules on monkey
      eyes. In addition, the development of focusing in newborn and presbyopia
      is analyzed. Histology was prepared by conventional and molecular
      immunofluorescence stainings on the compositions of zonules with
      fibrillin-1 (FBN 1) and lens capsule with collagen IV (COL IV), and in
      situ hybridization (ISH) analyses on frozen sections. Superficial
      circumferential attachments of zonule were found radially oriented between
      ciliary processes and anterior/posterior lens capsules forming a
      triangular figure. Two functional intralayer integrations were found above
      them; anterior-posterior crossed fibers over the equator and radial fibers
      distributed toward the anterior or posterior polar areas. These fibers
      were bound tightly to the deep layer connective tissues close to the lens
      epithelium. Fine zonular fibers were aggregated, gradually forming bundles
      and bifurcated again on the way to the capsule. The lateral striped
      staining pattern in bundles suggested their elastic nature. Response of
      alpha-helixes of collagen IV immunostaining was more positive on
      alpha-1,2,4 than alpha-3,5,6 on anterior- and posterior lens capsules.
      Newborn eyes revealed not fascicular but fine membranous zonules on the
      lens surface and small ciliary processes. ISH analysis revealed high
      synthetic expression of FBN 1 mRNA in cytoplasm of nonpigmented epithelial
      cells of ciliary processes. The synthetic expression of FBN 1 declined
      with aging. According to the mechanism of accommodation, active dynamic
      movement of anterior or posterior capsules play the main role of changing
      the lens configuration by two intralayer zonular integrations, including
      anterior-posterior crossed fibers over the equator and radial fibers
      toward anterior or posterior polar areas acting with coordinated
      contraction of circular or longitudinal ciliary muscles. The developmental
      change on focusing is brought about by synthesis of FBN 1 in the newborn
      eye. Anat Rec, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Influence of application parameters on bond strength of an "all in one"
      water-based self-etching primer/adhesive after 6 and 12 months of water
      aging.
PG  - 117-25
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate the influence of different application parameters
      on microtensile bond strength (microTBS) of an "all in one" water-based
      self-etching primer/adhesive to dentin. Extracted human third molars had
      their crowns transversally sectioned next to the dentinoenamel junction.
      Prompt-L-Pop adhesive was applied using five modes: (1) following the
      manufacturer's instructions (MI); (2) after 36% H(3)PO(4) etching (15 s)
      (AG); (3) after H(3)PO(4) etching and 5% NaOCl (2 min) with constant
      agitation (HG); (4) as a double layer (DL); and (5) for double the
      application time (DT). Resin build-ups were constructed with Tetric Ceram.
      After storage for 24 h, 6 months, or 12 months in water at 37 degrees C,
      the specimens were vertically sectioned into beams (cross-sectional areas,
      1 mm(2)). Each beam was tested in an Instron Machine at 0.5 mm/min.
      Analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls were used (P &lt; 0.05). Bonded
      interfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The highest microTBS values were
      obtained when AG was used, and the lowest when MI was employed. The HG,
      DL, and DT modes resulted in similar microTBS values. Water storage
      reduced microTBS in all groups except the MI group. SEM and TEM revealed
      hybrid layer and resin tag formation in all groups. Applied after AG, HG,
      DL, and DT, Prompt L-Pop adhesive provided adequate bond strength to
      dentin after 24 h of water storage. Bond strength decreased when specimens
      were stored in distilled water for 6 or 12 months.

TI  - Hyperostosis frontalis interna: criteria for sexing and aging a skeleton.
AB  - Estimation of sex and age in skeletons is essential in anthropological and
      forensic medicine investigations. The aim of the current study was to
      examine the potential of hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) as a
      criterion for determining sex and age in forensic cases. Macroscopic
      examination of the inner aspect of the frontal bone of 768 skulls (326
      males and 442 females) aged 1 to 103, which had undergone a head
      computerized tomography scan, was carried out using the volume rendering
      technique. HFI was divided into two categories: minor and major. HFI is a
      sex- and age-dependent phenomena, with females manifesting significantly
      higher prevalence than males (p &lt; 0.01). In both females and males,
      prevalence of HFI increases as age increases (p &lt; 0.01). We present herein
      the probabilities of designating an unknown skull to a specific sex and
      age cohort according to the presence of HFI (standardized to age
      distribution in an Israeli population). Moreover, we present the
      probability of an individual belonging to a specific sex or age cohort
      according to age or sex (respectively) and severity of HFI. We suggest a
      valid, reliable, and easy method for sex and age identification of unknown
      skulls.

TI  - Histone deacetylase regulates high mobility group A2-targeting microRNAs
      in human cord blood-derived multipotent stem cell aging.
AB  - Cellular senescence involves a reduction in adult stem cell self-renewal,
      and epigenetic regulation of gene expression is one of the main underlying
      mechanisms. Here, we observed that the cellular senescence of human
      umbilical cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) caused by
      inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity leads to down-regulation
      of high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) and, on the contrary, to up-regulation
      of p16(INK4A), p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1). We found that let-7a1,
      let-7d, let-7f1, miR-23a, miR-26a and miR-30a were increased during
      replicative and HDAC inhibitor-mediated senescence of hUCB-MSCs by
      microRNA microarray and real-time quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the
      configurations of chromatins beading on these miRNAs were prone to
      transcriptional activation during HDAC inhibitor-mediated senescence. We
      confirmed that miR-23a, miR-26a and miR-30a inhibit HMGA2 to accelerate
      the progress of senescence. These findings suggest that HDACs may play
      important roles in cellular senescence by regulating the expression of
      miRNAs that target HMGA2 through histone modification.

TI  - Breast Ptosis Managed by Mastopexy Using the Triple Flaps Procedure.
AB  - Breast ptosis is a highly unattractive appearance of the breast. In the
      mind, it is associated with aging, multiple pregnancies, lactation, and
      senile changes. Its correction by mastopexy presents one of the greatest
      challenges to the breast surgeon aiming at a pleasant full conical shape
      and stability of the results. The authors present their mastopexy
      procedure using a triple-flap method based on the principle of a superior
      pedicle flap mammaplasty. The technique, presented in detail, basically
      consists of a superior pedicle dermaglandular flap that carries the
      nipple-areola complex between outer and inner flaps. The outer flap is
      rotated inward and upward behind the main superior pedicle to give
      fullness to the breast and fixed to the chest wall. The inner flap is
      double-breasted on top or superficial to outer flap, and both are sutured
      to each other resembling a hammock or a cradle that carries the main
      superior pedicle middle flap. The results are presented and advantages
      discussed. This method, besides its simplicity, gives good projection with
      a pleasant and attractive conical shape to the breast and upper fullness,
      frequently negating the need for an implant. In addition, the results were
      stable in the long term, with no need for a mesh or any other foreign
      material.

TI  - Evidence of accumulated stress in Achilles and anterior knee tendons in
      elite badminton players.
AB  - Tendon-related injuries are a major problem, but the aetiology of
      tendinopathies is unknown. In tendinopathies as well as during
      unaccustomed loading, intra-tendinous flow can be detected indicating that
      extensive loading can provoke intra-tendinous flow. The aim of present
      study is to evaluate the vascular response as indicated by colour Doppler
      (CD) activity in both the Achilles and patella tendon after loading during
      high-level badminton matches. The Achilles tendon was subdivided into a
      mid-tendon, pre-insertional, and insertional region and the anterior knee
      tendons into a quadriceps-, patella- and tuberositas region.
      Intra-tendinous flow was measured using both a semi-quantitative grading
      system (CD grading) and a quantitative scoring system (CF) on colour
      Doppler. Intra-tendinous flow in the Achilles and anterior knee tendons
      was examined in fourteen single players before tournament and after 1st
      and 2nd match, respectively on both the dominant and non-dominant side.
      All players had abnormal intra-tendinous flow (Colour Doppler &gt;/= grade 2)
      in at least one tendon in at least one scan during the tournament. At
      baseline, only two of the 14 players had normal flow in all the tendons
      examined. After 1st match, tendencies to higher intra-tendinous flow were
      observed in both the dominant patella tendon and non-dominant quadriceps
      tendon (P-values n.s.). After 2nd match, intra-tendinous flow was
      significant increased in the dominant patella tendon (P = 0.009). In all
      other locations, there was a trend towards a stepwise increase in
      intra-tendinous flow. The preliminary results indicate that high amount of
      intra-tendinous flow was found in elite badminton players at baseline and
      was increased after repetitive loading, especially in the patella tendon
      (dominant leg). The colour Doppler measurement can be used to determine
      changes in intra-tendinous flow after repetitive loading.

TI  - Introduction to epigenomics and epigenome-wide analysis.
PG  - 243-65
AB  - Epigenetics is the study of heritable change other than those encoded in
      DNA sequence. Cytosine methylation of DNA at CpG dinucleotides is the most
      well-studied epigenetic phenomenon, although epigenetic changes also
      encompass non-DNA methylation mechanisms, such as covalent histone
      modifications, micro-RNA interactions, and chromatin remodeling complexes.
      Methylation changes, both global and gene specific, have been observed to
      be associated with disease, particularly in cancer.This chapter begins
      with a general overview of epigenomics, and then focuses on understanding
      and analyzing genome-wide cytosine methylation data. There are many
      microarray-based techniques available to measure cytosine methylation
      across the genome, as well as gold-standard techniques based on sequencing
      bisulfite converted DNA, which is used to measure methylation in a
      smaller, more targeted set of loci. We have provided an overview of many
      of the current technologies - their advantages, limitations, and recent
      improvements. Regardless of which technology is used, the goal is to
      produce a set of methylation measurements that are highly consistent with
      true methylation levels of the corresponding set of CpG
      dinucleotides.Identifying all loci with aberrant methylation or
      hypomethylation in disease, or in natural processes such as aging,
      requires the comparison of methylation levels across many samples. In such
      studies, the development of methylation-based diagnostic tools may be of
      interest, potentially to be used as early disease detection strategies
      based on a set of sentinel loci. In addition, the identification of loci
      with potentially reversible methylation events may result in new
      therapeutic options. Given the vast number of measurable sites,
      prioritization of candidate loci is an important and complex issue and
      rests on a foundation of appropriate statistical testing and
      summarization. Coupled with statistical estimates of importance, the
      genomic context of each locus measured may offer important information
      about the mechanisms by which epigenetic changes impact disease and allows
      us further refinement of candidate loci. We will conclude this chapter by
      identifying issues in building methylation-based models for prediction and
      potential directions of further statistical research in epigenetics.

TI  - Aging of cerebellar Purkinje cells.
AB  - Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output neurons in the cerebellar
      cortex, play an important role in the cerebellar circuit. PCs appear to be
      rather sensitive to aging, exhibiting significant changes in both
      morphology and function during senescence. This article reviews such
      changes during the normal aging process, including a decrease in the
      quantity of cells, atrophy in the soma, retraction in the dendritic
      arborizations, degeneration in the subcellular organelles, a decline in
      synapse density, disorder in the neurotransmitter system, and alterations
      in electrophysiological properties. Although these deteriorative changes
      occur during aging, compensatory mechanisms exist to counteract the
      impairments in the aging PCs. The possible neural mechanisms underlying
      these changes and potential preventive treatments are discussed.

TI  - Effects of plant polyphenols on ovarian follicular reserve in aging rats.
PG  - 737-45
AB  - The pool of ovarian primordial follicles is established during embryonic
      development or at birth. During the development from primordial to
      primary, secondary, and antral follicles, only a small portion of
      follicles can mature and successfully ovulate; the others are destined to
      degenerate through apoptotic or atretic loss. As aging advances, females
      ultimately enter the cessation phase of the estrous cycle and are no
      longer capable of fertilization. The presumption is that if we can slow
      down the process of folliculogenesis or decrease follicle loss, females
      may have a larger ovarian follicular reserve and a longer reproductive
      lifespan. In our study, rats underwent intragastric administration with
      tea polyphenols, quercetin (meletin), genistein, or resveratrol, once a
      day for 4 months (from age 12 to 15 months), to test whether they have
      positive effects on follicular reserve or ovarian functions. The results
      showed that rats treated with tea polyphenols (27.8 +/- 3.2) and quercetin
      (36.5 +/- 4.1) had a comparable number of healthy follicles to those of
      controls (26.9 +/- 3.8), although significantly fewer atretic follicles
      were observed in the tea polyphenol group (43.4 +/- 5.9 vs 79.7 +/- 7.5; p
      &lt; 0.001). Remarkably, both genistein- and resveratrol-treated rats had
      more healthy follicles (respectively, 42.8 +/- 3.9, p &lt; 0.05; and 51.9 +/-
      6.4, p &lt; 0.001) and fewer atretic follicles (respectively, 58.4 +/- 8.0, p
      &lt; 0.05; and 51.0 +/- 6.2, p &lt; 0.01) than controls. These results indicate
      that genistein and resveratrol can increase the ovarian follicular reserve
      and prolong the ovarian lifespan in rats, and their positive effects may
      be not only due to their intervention in the transition from primordial to
      primary follicle, but also due to the inhibiting effect on follicular
      atresia.

TI  - Obesity and Medicare Expenditure: Accounting for Age-Related Height Loss.
AB  - To determine the relationship between BMI and Medicare expenditure for
      adults 65-years and older and determine whether this relationship changes
      after accounting for misclassification due to age-related height loss.
      Using a cross sectional study design, the relationship between BMI and
      fee-for-service Medicare expenditure was examined among beneficiaries who
      completed the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) in 2002, were not
      enrolled in Medicare Health Maintenance Organization, had a self-reported
      height and weight, and were 65 and older (n = 7,706). Subjects were
      classified as underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese (obese I), and
      severely obese (obese II/III). To adjust BMI for the artifactual increase
      associated with age-related height loss, the reported height was
      transformed by adding the sex-specific age-associated height loss to the
      reported height in MCBS. The main outcome variable was total Medicare
      expenditure. There was a significant U-shaped pattern between unadjusted
      BMI and Medicare expenditure: underweight $4,581 (P &lt; 0.0003), normal
      weight $3,744 (P &lt; 0.0000), overweight $3,115 (reference), obese I $3,686
      (P &lt; 0.0039), and obese II/III $4,386 (P &lt; 0.0000). This pattern persisted
      after accounting for height loss: underweight $4,640 (P &lt; 0.0000), normal
      weight $3,451 (P &lt; 0.0507), overweight $3,165 (reference), obese I $3,915
      (P &lt; 0.0010), and obese II/III $4,385 (P &lt; 0.0004) compared to overweight.
      In older adults, minimal cost is not found at "normal" BMI, but rather in
      overweight subjects with higher spending in the obese and underweight
      categories. Adjusting for loss-of-height with aging had little affect on
      cost estimates.

TI  - Neighborhood walkability: older people's perspectives from four
      neighborhoods in Ottawa, Canada.
PG  - 293-312
AB  - This qualitative study examined older people's walking experiences in 4
      Ottawa neighborhoods. Seventy-five adults age 65 years and older who had
      lived in their neighborhoods for at least 2 yr participated in focus
      groups and individual interviews. Four themes were identified through data
      analysis: multidimensional personal meanings, navigating hostile walking
      environments, experiencing ambiguity, and getting around. Neighborhood
      walking was experienced within the continuum of personal and environmental
      change. Findings indicated that the concept of pedestrian connectivity
      must incorporate aspects of both intersection regulation and design to
      ensure relevance for an aging population. Participants called for more
      clarity about policies that affect pedestrian safety for older people. The
      overarching theme of getting around indicated that walkability assessments
      must consider how walking fits within an integrated transportation system
      and how accessible this system is for older people.

TI  - Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ Pumping Kinetics Regulates Timing of Local
      Ca2+ Releases and Spontaneous Beating Rate of Rabbit Sinoatrial Node
      Pacemaker Cells.
AB  - Rationale: Sinoatrial node cells (SANCs) generate local, subsarcolemmal
      Ca(2+) releases (LCRs) from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during late
      diastolic depolarization. LCRs activate an inward Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange
      current (INCX), which accelerates diastolic depolarization rate, prompting
      the next action potential (AP). The LCR period, ie, a delay between
      AP-induced Ca(2+) transient and LCR appearance, defines the time of late
      diastolic depolarization INCX activation. Mechanisms that control the LCR
      period, however, are still unidentified. Objective: To determine
      dependence of the LCR period on SR Ca(2+) refilling kinetics and establish
      links between regulation of SR Ca(2+) replenishment, LCR period, and
      spontaneous cycle length. Methods and Results: Spontaneous APs and SR
      luminal or cytosolic Ca(2+) were recorded using perforated patch and
      confocal microscopy, respectively. Time to 90% replenishment of SR Ca(2+)
      following AP-induced Ca(2+) transient was highly correlated with the time
      to 90% decay of cytosolic Ca(2+) transient (T-90C). Local SR Ca(2+)
      depletions mirror their cytosolic counterparts, LCRs, and occur following
      SR Ca(2+) refilling. Inhibition of SR Ca(2+) pump by cyclopiazonic acid
      dose-dependently suppressed spontaneous SANCs firing up to approximately
      50%. Cyclopiazonic acid and graded changes in phospholamban
      phosphorylation produced by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation,
      phosphodiesterase or protein kinase A inhibition shifted T-90C and
      proportionally shifted the LCR period and spontaneous cycle length
      (R(2)=0.98). Conclusions: The LCR period, a critical determinant of the
      spontaneous SANC cycle length, is defined by the rate of SR Ca(2+)
      replenishment, which is critically dependent on SR pumping rate, Ca(2+)
      available for pumping, supplied by L-type Ca(2+) channel, and ryanodine
      receptor Ca(2+) release flux, each of which is modulated by cAMP-mediated
      protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation.

TI  - Disrupted Pancreatic Exocrine Differentiation and Malabsorption in
      Response to Chronic Elevated Systemic Glucocorticoid.
AB  - Glucocorticoids are antiinflammatory therapeutics that have potent effects
      on cell differentiation. The aim of this study was to establish whether
      systemic glucocorticoid exposure significantly affects pancreatic
      differentiation in vivo because hepatocyte-like cells have been documented
      to occur in the diseased rodent pancreas. Expression of hepatic markers
      was examined in pancreata from mice genetically modified to secrete
      elevated circulating endogenous glucocorticoid [Tg(Crh)]. Tg(Crh) mice
      with elevated glucocorticoid appeared cushingoid and by 21 weeks of age
      were obese, insulin-resistant, and had extensive areas of hepatic gene
      expression in exocrine tissue. Acinar cells from Tg(Crh) mice costained
      for both amylase and cyp2e1, suggesting direct acinar-hepatic
      trans-differentiation. Hepatic expression increased with age in the
      pancreas to such an extent that malabsorption and rapid weight loss
      occurred in a subset of aging mice; this effect was reversed by dietary
      porcine pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Indeed, pancreatic expression
      of hepatic markers was prevented by adrenalectomy, establishing a direct
      role for glucocorticoid. Elevated levels of circulating glucocorticoid
      therefore promote a trans-differentiation of adult exocrine pancreas into
      hepatocyte-like cells, and chronic exposure results in pancreatic
      malfunction. Glucocorticoids are thus capable of modulating the
      differentiation of terminally differentiated adult cells.

TI  - Cigarette Smoke-Related Hydroquinone Induces Filamentous Actin
      Reorganization and Heat Shock Protein 27 Phosphorylation through p38 and
      Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1/2 in Retinal Pigment Epithelium.
      Implications for Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
AB  - Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-derived membranous debris named blebs,
      may accumulate and contribute to sub-RPE deposit formation, which is the
      earliest sign of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oxidative injury
      to the RPE might play a significant role in AMD. However, the underlying
      mechanisms are unknown. We previously reported that hydroquinone (HQ), a
      major pro-oxidant in cigarette smoke, foodstuff, and atmospheric
      pollutants, induces actin rearrangement and membrane blebbing in RPE cells
      as well as sub-RPE deposits in mice. Here, we show for the first time that
      phosphorylated Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), a key regulator of actin
      filaments dynamics, is up-regulated in RPE from patients with AMD. Also,
      HQ-induced nonlethal oxidative injury led to Hsp27mRNA up-regulation,
      dimer formation, and Hsp27 phosphorylation in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore,
      we found that a cross talk between p38 and extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase (ERK) mediates HQ-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation and actin aggregate
      formation, revealing ERK as a novel upstream mediator of Hsp27
      phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrated that Hsp25, p38, and ERK
      phosphorylation are increased in aging C57BL/6 mice chronically exposed to
      HQ, whereas Hsp25 expression is decreased. Our data suggest that
      phosphorylated Hsp27 might be a key mediator in AMD and HQ-induced
      oxidative injury to the RPE, which may provide helpful insights into the
      early cellular events associated with actin reorganization and bleb
      formation involved in sub-RPE deposits formation relevant to the
      pathogenesis of AMD.

TI  - Animal Aging and Regulation of Sympathetic Nerve Discharge.
AB  - Studies completed in human subjects have made seminal contributions to
      understanding the effects of age on sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
      regulation. Numerous experimental constraints limit the design of studies
      involving human subjects; therefore, completion of studies in animal
      models of aging would be expected to provide additional insight regarding
      mechanisms mediating age-related changes in sympathetic nerve discharge
      (SND) regulation. The present review assesses the current state of the
      literature regarding contributions from animal studies on the effect of
      advancing age on SND regulation, focusing primarily on studies that have
      used direct recordings of sympathetic nerve outflow. Few studies using
      direct SND recordings have been completed in animal models of aging,
      regardless of the fundamental component of SND regulation reviewed (basal
      levels, acute responsiveness, relationships between the discharges in
      sympathetic nerves, central neural regulation). SNS responsiveness to
      various acute stressors is altered in aged compared with young animals;
      however, mechanisms remain virtually unexplored. There is a marked dearth
      of studies that have used central neural microinjection techniques in
      conjunction with SND recordings in aged animals, making it difficult to
      develop an evidence-based framework regarding potential age-associated
      effects on central regulation of SND. Determination of age-related changes
      in mechanisms regulating SND is important for understanding relationships
      between chronic disease development and changes in sympathetic nervous
      system function; however, this can only be achieved by substantially
      extending the current knowledge base regarding the effects of age on SND
      regulation in animal studies.

TI  - Endogenous Testosterone and Mortality in Male Hemodialysis Patients: Is It
      the Result of Aging?
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Low serum testosterone levels in hemodialysis
      (HD) patients have recently been associated with cardiovascular risk
      factors and increased mortality. To confirm this observation, we
      investigated the predictive role of serum total testosterone levels on
      mortality in a large group of male HD patients from Turkey. Design,
      settings, participants, &amp; measurements: A total of 420 prevalent male HD
      patients were sampled in March 2005 and followed up for all-cause
      mortality. Serum total testosterone levels were measured by ELISA at
      baseline and studied in relation to mortality and cardiovascular risk
      profile. RESULTS: Mean testosterone level was 8.69 +/- 4.10 (0.17 to
      27.40) nmol/L. A large proportion of patients (66%) had testosterone
      deficiency (&lt;10 nmol/L). In univariate analysis, serum testosterone levels
      were positively correlated with creatinine and inversely correlated with
      age, body mass index, and lipid parameters. During an average follow-up of
      32 months, 104 (24.8%) patients died. The overall survival rate was
      significantly lower in patients within the low testosterone tertile (&lt;6.8
      nmol/L) compared with those within the high tertile (&gt;10.1 nmol/L; 64
      versus 81%; P = 0.004). A 1-nmol/L increase in serum testosterone level
      was associated with a 7% decrease in overall mortality (hazard ratio 0.93;
      95% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.98; P = 0.01); however, this association
      was dependent on age and other risk factors in adjusted Cox regression
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone deficiency is common in male HD
      patients. Although testosterone levels, per se, predicted mortality in
      this population, this association was largely dependent on age.

TI  - Age Differences in Orofacial Sensory Thresholds.
AB  - Declines in sensory functioning with aging are evident for many of the
      senses. In the present study, thresholds were determined for somatosensory
      (warming and cooling temperature, pain, touch, and two-point
      discrimination) and taste stimuli in 178 healthy individuals aged 20-89
      yrs. Somatosensory stimuli were applied to the upper lip (glabrous skin)
      and the chin (hairy skin). The sample was divided into two groups, based
      on a bimodal split "&lt; 45 yrs" and "&gt;/= 65 yrs". In all instances, there
      were elevations in thresholds for the older individuals. Further, males
      were less sensitive than females for cool at the chin site, for touch, and
      for sour taste. We conclude that there are elevations in sensory
      thresholds with age for multimodal somatosensory and gustatory senses.

TI  - Cisplatin nephrotoxicity aggravated by cardiovascular disease and diabetes
      in lung cancer patients.
AB  - Aging lung cancer patients may be at increased risk of Cisplatin (Cp)
      nephrotoxicity, because of comorbidities leading to accelerated aging of
      the kidneys. Therefore the Cp-induced impairement of renal function was
      compared between no comorbidity (NC) and hypertension+ ischemic heart
      disease (CD) patients or others having diabetes mellitus+ ischemic heart
      disease (DMIH). In a preliminary study GFR was measured by clearance of
      (99m)Tc-DTPA in 38 lung cancer patients with normal serum creatinine
      concentration ([creat]). Then, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was
      analysed retrospectively over 1st-4th cycles of Cp treatment among 242
      lung cancer patients with initially normal [creat]. GFR was repeatedly
      estimated by calculated creatinine clearance (eGFR). Pre-treatment GFR was
      57+/-3 mL.min(-1).m(-2) in those with normal (n=15) and 42+/-2 (p&lt;0.05) in
      others with pathologically increased (n=23) [creat] any time following
      their 2nd-4th Cp cycle. The retrospective analysis revealed that
      Cp-induced nephrotoxicity developed in 7.5% of NC (n=80), in 20.9% of CD
      (n=110) and in 30.8% of DMIH (n=52) subgroups. Within overall fall-out
      from further Cp chemotherapy, nephrotoxicity was responsible in 14% of NC,
      38% in CD and 75% in DMIH patients. A major portion of our aging lung
      cancer patients suffered from comorbidities leading to reduced renal
      resistance to Cp nephrotoxicity.

TI  - The Rps23rg gene family originated through retroposition of the ribosomal
      protein s23 mRNA and encodes proteins that decrease Alzheimer's
      {beta}-amyloid level and tau phosphorylation.
AB  - Retroposition is an important mechanism for gene origination. However,
      studies to elucidate the functions of new genes originated through
      retroposition, especially the functions related to diseases, are limited.
      We recently identified a mouse gene, Rps23 retroposed gene 1 (Rps23rg1),
      that regulates beta-amyloid (Abeta) level and tau phosphorylation, two
      major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and found that
      Rps23rg1 originated through retroposition of the mouse ribosomal protein
      S23 (Rps23) mRNA. Here we show that retroposition of Rps23 mRNA occurred
      multiple times in different species but only generated another
      functionally expressed Rps23rg1-homologous gene, Rps23rg2, in mice,
      whereas humans may not possess functional Rps23rg homologs. Both Rps23rg1
      and Rps23rg2 are reversely transcribed relative to the parental Rps23
      gene, expressed in various tissues, and encode proteins that interact with
      adenylate cyclases. Similar to the RPS23RG1 protein, RPS23RG2 can
      upregulate protein kinase A (PKA) activity to reduce the activity of
      glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), Abeta level, and tau phosphorylation.
      However, the effects of RPS23RG2 are weaker than those of RPS23RG1 and
      such a difference could be attributed to the extra carboxyl-terminal
      region of RPS23RG2, which may have an inhibitory effect. In addition, we
      show that the transmembrane domain of RPS23RG1 is important for its
      function. Together, our results present a new gene family, whose products
      and associated signaling pathways might prevent mice from developing
      AD-like pathologies.

TI  - "I'm Not Going to Die from the AIDS": Resilience in Aging with HIV
      Disease.
AB  - PURPOSE: Adults aging with HIV/AIDS can experience resilience in spite of
      the deleterious affects of the disease. This study seeks to examine the
      lived experiences of older adults with HIV/AIDS as it relates to strengths
      and resilience in dealing with this devastating disease. DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 adults,
      50 years and older, living with HIV/AIDS. The interview transcripts were
      analyzed using constant comparative methodology following the tenets of
      adaptive theory. RESULTS: The majority of informants expressed experiences
      of resilience and strengths as related to living with HIV/AIDS. Seven
      major themes emerged from the analysis including self-acceptance,
      optimism, will to live, generativity, self-management, relational living,
      and independence. IMPLICATIONS: The research identified the importance of
      strengths and resilience among older adults living with HIV/AIDS. Further
      research is needed to explore these phenomena with larger samples.
      Practitioners should identify and implement methods for assessing
      resilience among older HIV-infected adults.

TI  - Greater sadness reactivity in late life.
AB  - Although previous research suggests that overall emotional reactivity does
      not change with normal aging, it is possible that different emotions
      follow different developmental courses. We examined emotional reactivity
      to films selected to elicit sadness, disgust, and a neutral state in
      young, middle-aged and older adults (total N = 222). Physiology and
      expressive behavior were measured continuously and reports of subjective
      emotional experience were obtained following each film. Results indicated
      that older adults reported greater sadness in response to all films and
      greater physiological responses to the sadness film than did the younger
      age groups. There were no age differences found in self-reported disgust
      or in behavioral expressions of sadness or disgust in response to any
      film. The age differences that were found were maintained even after
      controlling for pre-film self-reported sadness and for personal
      experiences of loss. These findings support the notion that sadness
      reactivity is heightened with age.

TI  - Thymic fatness and approaches to enhance thymopoietic fitness in aging.
AB  - With advancing age, the thymus undergoes striking fibrotic and fatty
      changes that culminate in its transformation into adipose tissue. As the
      thymus involutes, reduction in thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells
      precede the emergence of mature lipid-laden adipocytes. Dogma dictates
      that adipocytes are 'passive' cells that occupy non-epithelial thymic
      space or 'infiltrate' the non-cellular thymic niches. The provenance and
      purpose of ectopic thymic adipocytes during aging in an organ that is
      required for establishment and maintenance of T cell repertoire remains an
      unsolved puzzle. Nonetheless, tantalizing clues about elaborate reciprocal
      relationship between thymic fatness and thymopoietic fitness are emerging.
      Blocking or bypassing the route toward thymic adiposity may complement the
      approaches to rejuvenate thymopoiesis and immunity in elderly.

TI  - Stem cells and the aging hematopoietic system.
AB  - Advancing age is accompanied by a number of clinically significant
      conditions arising in the hematopoietic system that include: diminution
      and decreased competence of the adaptive immune system, elevated incidence
      of certain autoimmune diseases, increased hematological malignancies, and
      elevated incidence of age-associated anemia. As with most tissues, the
      aged hematopoietic system also exhibits a reduced capacity to regenerate
      and return to normal homeostasis after injury or stress. Evidence suggests
      age-dependent functional alterations within the hematopoietic stem cell
      compartment significantly contribute to many of these pathophysiologies.
      Recent developments have shed light on how aging of the hematopoietic stem
      cell compartment contributes to hematopoietic decline through diverse
      mechanisms.

TI  - Evaluation of three methodologies to estimate the VO(2max) in people of
      different ages.
AB  - Aging and gender are factors that affect the variation of physical work
      capacity. The present paper highlights the importance of the metabolism
      used by ergonomics to establish the appropriate limits of loads at work.
      This study compares the aerobic capacity of people from 20 to 71 years old
      split in 5 different groups. The laboratory experiment tested 33
      volunteers (19 women and 14 men). A submaximal step test was used to
      measure the VO(2) using a portable breath by breath metabolic system and a
      telemetric heart rate monitor. Three methods to estimate the VO(2max) were
      compared: 1) a direct measurement of VO(2), 2) estimation by heart rate,
      and 3) a step test method using predetermined charts. Significant
      difference was encountered among the estimation methods as well as among
      the age ranges (F(2,92)=6.43, p&lt;0.05y F(4,92)=7.18, p&lt;0.05 respectively).
      The method of direct measurement and the method of predetermined charts
      were different for the estimation of the VO(2max) with a confidence level
      of 95%. The method of predetermined charts is better adapted for males and
      people younger than 30 years. The estimation through non invasive heart
      rate apparatus was a good appraiser of the maximal oxygen consumption
      considering both genders and all the age groups.

TI  - Poly(ethylene carbonate) as a surface-eroding biomaterial for in situ
      forming parenteral drug delivery systems: A feasibility study.
AB  - To evaluate the technical feasibility of poly(ethylene carbonate), PEC,
      for injectable in situ forming drug delivery systems, the physical
      properties of PEC solutions were characterized. The solubility of PEC was
      investigated in different solvents, and the Hildebrand solubility
      parameters and Flory-Huggins interaction parameters of PEC were
      determined. By turbidity titration, the experimental ternary phase diagram
      of water-NMP/DMSO-PEC was constructed. NMP solution required more water to
      precipitate PEC compared to DMSO solution. The dynamic viscosity of PEC
      solution increased at lower temperature, higher polymer concentration and
      longer aging time. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements
      confirmed only weak physical interactions in the system after aging, and
      the physical aging effect was thermo-reversible. Release of NMP from PEC
      formulations was twofold slower than that of DMSO at similar
      concentrations. The morphology of PEC depots after injection into aqueous
      solution was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A DMSO
      formulation of bovine serum albumin displayed less burst release than a
      NMP formulation. In summary, our investigations demonstrate that in situ
      depot forming systems can be obtained from PEC solutions. Moreover, a
      solution of PEC in DMSO would be preferred over NMP due to the reduced
      burst release.

TI  - Medicinal uses of the mushroom Cordyceps militaris: Current state and
      prospects.
AB  - Cordyceps militaris is a potential harbour of bio-metabolites for herbal
      drugs and evidences are available about its applications for
      revitalization of various systems of the body from ancient times. Amongst
      all the species, C. militaris is considered as the oldest source of some
      useful chemical constituents. Besides their popular applications for tonic
      medicine by the all stairs of the community, the constituents of C.
      militaris are now used extensively in modern systems of medicine. The
      current survey records the mysterious potentials of C. militaris are
      boosting up the present herbal treatments, as well as gearing up the green
      pharmacy revolution, in order to create a friendly environment with
      reasonable safety. Evidence showed that the active principles of C.
      militaris are beneficial to act as pro-sexual, anti-inflammatory,
      anti-oxidant/anti-aging, anti-tumour/anti-cancer/anti-leukemic,
      anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, immunomodulatory, anti-microbial,
      anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-protozoal, insecticidal,
      larvicidal, anti-fibrotic, steroidogenic, hypoglacaemic, hypolipidaemic,
      anti-angiogenetic, anti-diabetic, anti-HIV, anti-malarial, anti-fatigue,
      neuroprotective, liver-protective, reno-protective as well as
      pneumo-protective, let alone their other synergistic activities, which let
      it be marketable in the western countries as over-the-counter medicine. A
      number of culture techniques for this mushroom have been noticed, for
      example, storage/stock culture, pre-culture, popular/indigenous culture
      (spawn culture, husked rice culture and saw dust culture) and,
      special/laboratory culture (shaking culture, submerged culture, surface
      liquid culture and continuous/repeated batch operation). The prospects for
      herbal biotechnology regarding drug discovery using C. militaris
      delivering what it has promised are high, as the technology is now
      extremely more powerful than before. This study chiefly highlights the
      medicinal uses of the mushroom C. militaris including its culture
      techniques, also aiming to draw sufficient attention of the researchers to
      the frontier research needs in this context.

TI  - Mapping the entire human corneal nerve architecture.
AB  - We developed an approach to generate a three-dimensional map that
      facilitates the assessment of epithelial nerve density in different
      corneal areas to define aging and gender influence on human corneal nerve
      architecture. Twenty-eight fresh human eyes from 14 donors of different
      ages were studied. Corneal nerves were stained and consecutive images
      acquired with a fluorescence microscope, recorded at the same plane, and
      merged for viewing the complete epithelial and stromal nerve architecture.
      After whole mount examination, the same cornea was also used for
      transection. Stromal nerves entered the cornea in a radial pattern,
      subsequently dividing into smaller branches. Some branches connected at
      the center of the stroma, but most penetrated upward into the epithelium.
      No differences were observed between nerve densities in the four corneal
      quadrants. Epithelial innervation in the limbal and most of the peripheral
      area was supplied by a superficial network surrounding the limbal area.
      Central epithelial nerves were supplied by branches of the stromal nerve
      network. Epithelial nerve density and terminal numbers were higher in the
      center of the cornea, rather than the periphery. There were no differences
      in epithelial nerve density between genders, but there was a progressive
      nerve density reduction concomitant with aging, mainly in eye samples of
      donors 70-years of age and older. The modified technique of tissue
      preparation used for this study allowed for observation of new nerve
      structure features and, for the first time, provided a complete view of
      the human corneal nerve architecture. Our study reveals that aging
      decreases the number of central epithelial nerve terminals, and increases
      the presence of irregular anomalies beneath the basal layer.

TI  - Alterations in the self-renewal and differentiation ability of bone marrow
      mesenchymal stem cells in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - R149
AB  - ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic
      autoimmune disease primarily involving the synovium. Evidence in recent
      years has suggested that the bone marrow (BM) may be involved, and even be
      the initiating site of the disease. Abnormalities in haemopoietic stem
      cells (HSC) survival, proliferation and aging have been described in
      patients affected by RA and ascribed to abnormal support by the BM
      microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and their progeny
      constitute important components of the BM niche. In this study we test the
      hypothesis that the onset of inflammatory arthritis is associated with
      altered self-renewal and differentiation of bone marrow MSC, which alters
      the composition of the BM microenvironment. METHODS: We have used Balb/C
      Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist knock-out mice, which spontaneously
      develop RA-like disease in 100% of mice by 20 weeks of age to determine
      the number of mesenchymal progenitors and their differentiated progeny
      before, at the start and with progression of the disease. RESULTS: We
      showed a decrease in the number of mesenchymal progenitors with adipogenic
      potential and decreased bone marrow adipogenesis before disease onset.
      This is associated with a decrease in osteoclastogenesis. Moreover at the
      onset of disease a significant increase in all mesenchymal progenitors is
      observed together with a block in their differentiation to osteoblasts.
      This is associated with accelerated bone loss. CONCLUSIONS: Significant
      changes occur in the BM niche with the establishment and progression of
      RA-like disease. Those changes may be responsible for aspects of the
      disease, including advance of osteoporosis. An understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms leading to those changes may lead to new strategies
      for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Long-term effects of conjugated equine estrogen therapies on
      domain-specific cognitive function: results from the Women's Health
      Initiative study of cognitive aging extension.
PG  - 1263-71
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether small decrements in global cognitive
      function that conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) therapies have been shown
      to produce in older women persist after cessation and extend to specific
      cognitive domains. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING:
      Fourteen clinical centers of the Women's Health Initiative. PARTICIPANTS:
      Two thousand three hundred four women aged 65 to 80 free of probable
      dementia at enrollment. INTERVENTION: CEE 0.625 mg/d with or without
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 10 mg/d) and matching placebos.
      MEASUREMENTS: Annual administrations of a battery of cognitive tests
      during and after the trial. RESULTS: Assignment to CEE-based therapies was
      associated with small mean relative decrements in global cognitive
      function and several domain-specific cognitive functions during the trial,
      which largely persisted through up to 4 years after the trial. The
      strongest statistical evidence was for global cognitive function
      (0.07-standard deviation decrements during (P=.007) and after (P=.01) the
      trial. For domain-specific scores, the mean decrements were slightly
      smaller, were less significant, and tended to be larger for CEE-alone
      therapy. CONCLUSION: CEE-based therapies, when initiated after the age of
      65, produce a small broad-based decrement in cognitive function that
      persists after their use is stopped, but the differences in cognitive
      function are small and would not be detectable or have clinical
      significance for an individual woman. Differences in effects between
      cognitive domains suggest that more than one mechanism may be involved.

TI  - Opposite effects of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on mitochondrial
      respiration in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 806-14
AB  - AIM: Skeletal muscle insulin resistance has been linked to mitochondrial
      dysfunction. We examined how improvements in muscular insulin sensitivity
      following rosiglitazone (ROSI) or pioglitazone (PIO) treatment would
      affect muscle mitochondrial function in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Muscle biopsies were obtained from 21 patients
      with T2DM before and after 12 weeks on either ROSI (4 mg once daily) [n =
      12; age, 59.2 +/- 2.2 years; body mass index (BMI), 29.6 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2)]
      or PIO (30 mg once daily) (n = 9; age, 56.3 +/- 2.4 years; BMI, 29.5 +/-
      1.5 kg/m(2)). An age- and BMI-matched control group was also included (n =
      8; age, 61.8 +/- 2.3 years; BMI, 28.4 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)). Insulin
      sensitivity, citrate synthase- and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase
      (HAD) activity, intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) and protein content of
      complexes I-IV were measured, while mitochondrial respiration per
      milligram muscle was measured in saponin-treated skinned muscle fibres
      using high-resolution respirometry. RESULTS: Mitochondrial respiration per
      milligram muscle was lower in T2DM compared to controls at baseline and
      decreased during ROSI treatment but increased during PIO treatment.
      Citrate synthase activity and average protein content of complexes I-IV
      were unchanged in the ROSI group, but protein content of complexes II and
      III increased during PIO treatment. Insulin sensitivity improved in all
      patients, but IMTG levels were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We show opposite
      effects of ROSI and PIO on mitochondrial respiration, and also show that
      insulin sensitivity can be improved independently of changes in
      mitochondrial respiration. We confirm that mitochondrial respiration is
      reduced in T2DM compared to age- and BMI-matched control subjects.

TI  - Potential therapeutic applications of tetrahydrobiopterin: from inherited
      hyperphenylalaninemia to mitochondrial diseases.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) is an essential enzymatic cofactor in the
      formation of key neurotransmitters and nitric oxide (NO). It also has a
      cellular protective role as an antioxidant and scavenger of reactive
      nitrogen or oxygen species. Inherited hyperphenylalaninemia, which is
      caused by mutations in converting enzymes responsible for BH(4) synthesis,
      was the first reported disease implicating BH(4). Oxidative stress can
      also cause decreased BH(4) levels, leading to uncoupling of BH(4)-nitric
      oxide synthase (NOS) and diminished NO, further aggravating numerous
      pathologies. BH(4) deficiency is found in cardiovascular,
      neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases and is also involved in aging
      and mitochondrial dysfunction. BH(4) supplementation successfully prevents
      the development or progression of these diseases and thus has valuable
      clinical potential.

      mitochondrial function.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - Mitochondria may play important roles in metabolic diseases,
      neurodegeneration, and aging. Therefore, noninvasive methods to assess
      mitochondrial metabolic function in humans are urgently needed. We
      demonstrated that the (13)C-breath test using [1-(13)C] acetate and
      [1-(13)C] pyruvate holds great potential for assessing the metabolic
      status in mitochondria. The (13)C-breath test allows us to assess dynamic
      metabolic pathways noninvasively within 60 min. This test will not only
      facilitate clinical evaluation of patients but also provide huge
      opportunities for further understanding of these conditions. The potential
      of the (13)C-breath test using (13)C-labeled pyruvate in humans cannot be
      overemphasized.

TI  - Role of autophagy in diabetes and mitochondria.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and
      failure of pancreatic beta-cells producing insulin. Mitochondrial
      dysfunction may play a role in both processes of diabetes. Autophagy
      maintains cellular homeostasis through degradation and recycling of
      organelles such as mitochondria. As dysfunctional mitochondria are the
      main organelles removed by autophagy, we studied the role of autophagy in
      diabetes using mice with beta-cell-specific deletion of the Atg7 gene.
      Atg7-mutant mice showed reduction in beta-cell mass and pancreatic insulin
      content. Electron microscopy showed swollen mitochondria and other
      ultrastructural changes in autophagy-deficient beta-cells. Insulin
      secretory function ex vivo was also impaired. As a result, Atg7-mutant
      mice showed hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. These results suggest that
      autophagy is necessary to maintain structure, mass, and function of
      beta-cells. Besides its effect on beta-cells, autophagy may affect insulin
      sensitivity because mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in
      insulin resistance and autophagy is involved in the maintenance of the
      organelles. Furthermore, since aging is associated with impaired glucose
      tolerance, decline of autophagic activity may be involved in
      age-associated reduction of glucose tolerance.

TI  - A role for the CISD2 gene in lifespan control and human disease.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - CISD2, the causative gene for Wolfram syndrome 2 (WFS2), is an
      evolutionarily conserved novel gene. Recently, we have demonstrated that
      CISD2 is involved in mammalian lifespan control; this work also
      establishes WFS2 as a mitochondria-mediated disorder and effectively links
      CISD2 gene function, mitochondrial integrity, and aging in mammals. In
      wild-type mice, the expression levels of CISD2 decrease in an
      age-dependent manner during the naturally aging process; this correlates
      with mitochondrial breakdown and parallels the development of an aged
      phenotype. Future work will examine how the CISD2 knockout mouse helps us
      to understand WFS2 pathogenesis, as well as exploring the potential
      effects of increased CISD2 expression. In addition, it will be of great
      interest to compare gene activity and/or protein function between normal
      human populations and long-lived centenarian groups. Together, human and
      mouse genetic studies should provide evidence as to whether CISD2 is a
      "master gene" for extreme old age.

TI  - Effects of Oxidative Stress on Behavior, Physiology, and the Redox Thiol
      Proteome of Caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  - Accumulation of reactive oxygen species has been implicated in various
      diseases and aging. However, the precise physiological effects of
      accumulating oxidants are still largely undefined. Here, we applied a
      short-term peroxide stress treatment to young Caenorhabditis elegans and
      measured behavioral, physiological, and cellular consequences. We
      discovered that exposure to peroxide stress causes a number of immediate
      changes, including loss in mobility, decreased growth rate, and decreased
      cellular ATP levels. Many of these alterations, which are highly
      reminiscent of changes in aging animals, are reversible, suggesting the
      presence of effective antioxidant systems in young C. elegans. One of
      these antioxidant systems involves the highly abundant protein
      peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX 2), whose gene deletion causes phenotypes
      symptomatic of chronic peroxide stress and shortens lifespan. Applying the
      quantitative redox proteomic technique OxICAT to oxidatively stressed
      wild-type and prdx 2 deletion worms, we identified oxidation-sensitive
      cysteines in 40 different proteins, including proteins involved in
      mobility and feeding (e.g., MYO 2, LET-75), protein translation and
      homeostasis (e.g., EFT 1, HSP 1), and ATP regeneration (e.g., NDPK). The
      oxidative modification of some of these redox-sensitive cysteines may
      contribute to the physiological and behavioral changes observed in
      oxidatively stressed animals.

TI  - Base Excision Repair and lesion-dependent sub-pathways for repair of
      oxidative DNA damage.
AB  - Nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are under continuous assault by a
      combination of environmentally- and endogenously-derived reactive oxygen
      species, inducing the formation and accumulation of mutagenic, toxic
      and/or genome destabilizing DNA lesions. Failure to resolve these lesions
      through one or more DNA repair processes is associated with genome
      instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, inflammation,
      aging and cancer; emphasizing the importance of characterizing the
      pathways and proteins involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. This
      review focuses on the repair of oxidative damage-induced lesions in
      nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mediated by the base excision repair (BER)
      pathway in mammalian cells. We discuss the multiple BER sub-pathways that
      are initiated by one of eleven different DNA glycosylases of three
      subtypes: (i) bi-functional with an associated ss-lyase activity; (ii)
      monofunctional and (iii) bi-functional with an associated ss,delta-lyase
      activity. These three subtypes of DNA glycosylases all initiate BER but
      yield different chemical intermediates and hence different BER complexes
      to complete repair. Additionally, we briefly summarize alternate repair
      events mediated by BER proteins and the role of BER in the repair of
      mitochondrial DNA damage induced by ROS. Finally, we discuss the
      relationship of BER and oxidative DNA damage in the onset of human
      disease.

TI  - The Development and Evaluation of an Inpatient Palliative Care Admission
      Triage Tool.
AB  - Abstract Background: An increased demand for palliative care services has
      been demonstrated, in part due to an aging population and an enhanced role
      of palliative care in nonmalignant illness. In particular, there is a
      demand for inpatient palliative care unit beds, with several services now
      creating waiting lists for admission. The aim of this study was to explore
      the development, implementation, and outcomes following the introduction
      of an inpatient palliative care admission triage tool. Methods: The study
      consisted of two phases: (1) a developmental phase, in which a
      purposive-sampled group participated in a series of semistructured
      discussions to determine the clinical and administrative criteria relevant
      for consideration of admission priority and (2) an implementation and
      evaluation phase. This second phase consisted of a 3-month trial of the
      tool at two inpatient palliative care units (involving three separate
      campuses), with subsequent evaluation of quantitative and qualitative data
      related to admission processes. Results: Of the 234 patients, there was a
      suggestion that those with less urgent needs indicated by a low admission
      score spent more time on the waiting list. Subsequent qualitative analysis
      demonstrated acceptance of the tool by clinicians, who stated it supported
      the decision-making processes, and was a useful education aid. Conclusion:
      This study represents the first reported attempt to define the priorities
      for a waiting list for admission to palliative care units, and
      demonstrates its utility in providing a transparent process for palliative
      care units to manage the competing needs of patients referred for care.

TI  - Seed treatments with Trichoderma harzianum alleviates biotic, abiotic and
      physiological stresses in germinating seeds and seedlings.
AB  - Trichoderma spp. are endophytic plant symbionts that are widely used as
      seed treatments to control diseases and to enhance plant growth and yield.
      While some recent work has been published on their abilities to alleviate
      abiotic stresses, specific knowledge of mechanisms, abilities to control
      multiple plant stress factors and their effects on seeds and seedlings is
      lacking. We examined the effects of seed treatment with T. harzianum
      strain T22 on germination of seeds exposed to biotic stress (seed and
      seedling disease caused by Pythium ultimum) and abiotic stresses (osmotic,
      salinity, chilling, or heat stress). We also evaluated the ability of the
      beneficial fungus to overcome physiological stress (poor seed quality
      induced by seed aging). If seeds were not under any of the stresses noted
      above, T22 generally had little effect upon seedling performance. However,
      under stress treated seeds germinated consistently faster and more
      uniformly than untreated seeds whether the stress was osmotic, salt or
      suboptimal temperatures. The consistent response to varying stresses
      suggests a common mechanism through which the plant-fungal association
      enhances tolerance to a wide range of abiotic stresses as well as biotic
      stress. A common factor that negatively affects plants under these stress
      conditions is accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), and we
      tested the hypothesis that T22 reduced damages resulting from accumulation
      of ROS in stressed plants. Treatment of seeds reduced accumulation of
      lipid peroxides in seedlings under osmotic stress or in aged seeds. In
      addition, we showed the effect of exogenous application of an antioxidant,
      glutathione, or application of T22, resulted in similar positive effect on
      seed germination under osmotic stress or in aged seeds. These evidences
      support the model that Trichoderma harzianum strain T22 increases seedling
      vigor and ameliorates stress by inducing plants physiological protection
      against oxidative damage.

PG  - 52-62
AB  - The lifetime exposure of organisms to oxidative stress influences many
      aging processes which involve the turnover of the extracellular matrix. In
      this study, we identify the redox-responsive molecular signals that drive
      senescence-associated (SA) matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression.
      Precise biochemical monitoring revealed that senescent fibroblasts
      increase steady-state (H(2)O(2)) 3.5-fold (13.7-48.6 pM) relative to young
      cells. Restricting H(2)O(2) production through low O(2) exposure or by
      antioxidant treatments prevented SA increases in MMP-1 expression. The
      H(2)O(2)-dependent control of SA MMP-1 is attributed to sustained JNK
      activation and c-jun recruitment to the MMP-1 promoter. SA JNK activation
      corresponds to increases and decreases in the levels of its activating
      kinase (MKK-4) and inhibitory phosphatase (MKP-1), respectively. Enforced
      MKP-1 expression negates SA increases in JNK phosphorylation and MMP-1
      production. Overall, these studies define redox-sensitive signaling
      networks regulating SA MMP-1 expression and link the free radical theory
      of aging to initiation of aberrant matrix turnover.

TI  - Measures of menopause driven differences in levels of blood lipids,
      follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone in women aged 35 to
      60 years: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III and
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess the
      association of the menopausal transition with differences in lipid and
      endogenous hormone levels in normal [18.5 kg/m &lt;/= body mass index (BMI)
      &lt;/= 24.99 kg/m] and overweight (BMI &gt;24.99 kg/m) women. METHODS:: The
      study was conducted on women age 35 to 60 years from the Third National
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and from the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey surveys conducted between the years 1999 and
      2002. Menstrual cycle-based menopause status was defined for women who had
      not had surgical menopause, did not use contraceptives, did not smoke, and
      did not breast-feed during the examination, by months since the last
      period (&lt;2, 2-12, and &gt;12 mo for premenopause, perimenopause, and
      postmenopause, respectively). RESULTS:: There were no significant
      differences in age-adjusted total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
      among the menopausal periods in the normal BMI class. The pattern of
      differences in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level differed
      between the normal and obese BMI classes. The activity of luteinizing
      hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone was statistically different
      between premenopause and perimenopause and premenopause and postmenopause
      in the normal BMI class. A different picture was observed for the analysis
      of differences in raw parameters. In this case more differences between
      menopausal phases were observed for all of the studied parameters.
      CONCLUSIONS:: Aging plays a role at least as important as menopause during
      the menopausal transition. However, at the current stage, it is impossible
      to assess the relative weights of aging and the menopausal transition on
      the differences in the studied parameters.

AB  - Assessment of biomarkers that reflect objective indicators of
      physiological processes has become increasingly popular in psychological
      research on stress and aging. The current article reviews biomarkers of
      the neuroendocrine and immune systems, including issues related to
      measurement and normative age-related changes. We also discuss how
      exposure to stressors can provoke changes in these biomarkers and propose
      that stressful experiences may accelerate age-related declines in these
      systems. We recommend that future research examining physical health and
      aging incorporate dynamic and multivariate methods for assessing links
      between stressors and biomarkers.

TI  - MicroRNA, mRNA, and protein expression link development and aging in human
      and macaque brain.
AB  - Changes in gene expression levels determine differentiation of tissues
      involved in development and are associated with functional decline in
      aging. Although development is tightly regulated, the transition between
      development and aging, as well as regulation of post-developmental
      changes, are not well understood. Here, we measured messenger RNA (mRNA),
      microRNA (miRNA), and protein expression in the prefrontal cortex of
      humans and rhesus macaques over the species' life spans. We find that few
      gene expression changes are unique to aging. Instead, the vast majority of
      miRNA and gene expression changes that occur in aging represent reversals
      or extensions of developmental patterns. Surprisingly, many gene
      expression changes previously attributed to aging, such as down-regulation
      of neural genes, initiate in early childhood. Our results indicate that
      miRNA and transcription factors regulate not only developmental but also
      post-developmental expression changes, with a number of regulatory
      processes continuing throughout the entire life span. Differential
      evolutionary conservation of the corresponding genomic regions implies
      that these regulatory processes, although beneficial in development, might
      be detrimental in aging. These results suggest a direct link between
      developmental regulation and expression changes taking place in aging.

TI  - Genetic ancestry in lung-function predictions.
PG  - 321-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-identified race or ethnic group is used to determine
      normal reference standards in the prediction of pulmonary function. We
      conducted a study to determine whether the genetically determined
      percentage of African ancestry is associated with lung function and
      whether its use could improve predictions of lung function among persons
      who identified themselves as African American. METHODS: We assessed the
      ancestry of 777 participants self-identified as African American in the
      Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and
      evaluated the relation between pulmonary function and ancestry by means of
      linear regression. We performed similar analyses of data for two
      independent cohorts of subjects identifying themselves as African
      American: 813 participants in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition
      (HABC) study and 579 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study
      (CHS). We compared the fit of two types of models to lung-function
      measurements: models based on the covariates used in standard prediction
      equations and models incorporating ancestry. We also evaluated the effect
      of the ancestry-based models on the classification of disease severity in
      two asthma-study populations. RESULTS: African ancestry was inversely
      related to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and forced vital
      capacity in the CARDIA cohort. These relations were also seen in the HABC
      and CHS cohorts. In predicting lung function, the ancestry-based model fit
      the data better than standard models. Ancestry-based models resulted in
      the reclassification of asthma severity (based on the percentage of the
      predicted FEV(1)) in 4 to 5% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Current
      predictive equations, which rely on self-identified race alone, may
      misestimate lung function among subjects who identify themselves as
      African American. Incorporating ancestry into normative equations may
      improve lung-function estimates and more accurately categorize disease
      severity. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)

TI  - Effects of chilling rate and spray-chilling on weight loss and tenderness
      in beef strip loin steaks.
PG  - 430-5
AB  - We evaluated the effects of chilling rate and the use of a spray-chilling
      system on the weight loss by evaporation on carcasses. We also evaluated
      the effects on meat purge in vacuum package, cooking losses, and on
      parameters related to the tenderness of strip loin steaks (M. longissimus
      lumborum). Forty non-castrated males of approximately 12 months old,
      finished in feed-lot were harvested in 16 Montana cattle (a composite
      breed), and 24 SimmentalxNellore crossbred cattle. After bleeding, the
      bodies were electrically stimulated and assigned to one of the four
      treatments: conventional air-chilling (CAC), conventional spray-chilling
      (CSC), slow air-chilling (SAC), and slow spray-chilling (SSC). Strip loin
      steaks (M. longissimus lumborum) of approximately 2.5 cm thick were
      removed, vacuum packed and aged for 7, 14, 30 or 60 days. Samples were
      analyzed for sarcomere length, myofibrillar fragmentation index,
      Warner-Bratzler shear force, and weight losses by purge and cooking.
      Spraying was efficient in reducing weight loss by evaporation (P&lt;0.05).
      Effects of treatments and aging period on purge losses were observed,
      where samples from sprayed carcasses or aged cuts showed higher losses.
      Cooking losses were not affected either by spraying or aging. The slow
      chilling, with or without spraying, was more efficient in producing strip
      loin steaks with lower average shear force and longer sarcomere. The
      myofibrillar fragmentation index increased with aging time, but was not
      affected by carcasses spraying.

TI  - Influence of the microenvironment of thiol groups in low molecular mass
      thiols and serum albumin on the reaction with methylglyoxal.
AB  - Methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive alpha-oxoaldehyde that is produced in
      higher quantities in diabetes, uremia, oxidative stress, aging and
      inflammation, reacts with the thiol groups (in addition to the amino and
      guanidino groups) of proteins. This causes protein modification, formation
      of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) and cross-linking. Low molecular
      mass thiols can be used as competitive targets for MG, preventing the
      reactions mentioned above. Therefore, this paper investigated how the
      microenvironment of the thiol group in low molecular mass thiols
      (cysteine, N-acetylcysteine (NAcCys), carboxymethylcysteine (CMC) and
      glutathione (GSH)) and human serum albumin (HSA) affected the thiol
      reaction with MG. The SH group reaction course was monitored by (1)H-NMR
      spectroscopy and spectrophotometric quantification. Changes in the HSA
      molecules were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The microenvironment of the SH group
      had a major effect on its reactivity and on the product yield. The
      reactivity of SH groups decreased in the order Cys&gt;GSH&gt;NAcCys. CMC did not
      react. The percentages of the reacted SH groups in the equilibrium state
      were almost equal, regardless of the ratio of thiol compound/MG (1:1, 1:2,
      1:5): 38.1+/-0.9%; 38.2+/-0.7% and 39.0+/-0.8% for Cys; 26.5+/-0.6%;
      26.6+/-2.6% and 27.4+/-2.5% for GSH; 10.8+/-0.9%; and 11.2+/-0.7% and
      12.2+/-0.9% for NAcCys, respectively. Our results explain why substances
      containing alpha-amino-beta-mercapto-ethane as a pharmacophore are
      successful scavengers of MG. In equilibrium, HSA SH reacted in high
      percentages both with an insufficient amount and with an excess of MG (55%
      and 65%, respectively). An analysis of the hydrophobicity of the
      microenvironment of the SH group on the HSA surface showed that it could
      contribute to high levels of SH modification, leading to an increase in
      the scavenging activity of the albumin thiol.

TI  - A prospective 8-year evaluation of a mild two-step self-etching adhesive
      and a heavily filled two-step etch-and-rinse system in non-carious
      cervical lesions.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical
      retention to dentin of a two-step self-etching adhesive system Clearfil SE
      Bond and a two-step etch-and-rinse system PQ1. METHODS: A total of 119
      Class V restorations were placed in non-carious cervical lesions without
      intentional involvement of the enamel incisal of the lesions. The
      restorations were evaluated yearly during an 8-year follow-up. Clinical
      dentin bonding efficiency was determined by the percentage of lost
      restorations at each of the recalls. RESULTS: At 8 years, 112 restorations
      could be evaluated. Both adhesives fulfilled the ADA 18-month full
      acceptance criteria for retention with a retention rate of 90.6% for PQ1
      and 98.2% for Clearfil SE Bond. The loss rates increased then considerably
      after 2 and 3 years, respectively. The cumulative loss rates at 8 years
      were 25.5% for Clearfil SE and 39.3% for PQ1 (p=0.12). No significant
      differences were observed between lesions with sclerotic and non-sclerotic
      dentin. The size of the lesions did not influence the bonding
      effectiveness. A lower loss rate was found for the restorations placed in
      lesions slightly roughened before etching. CONCLUSION: Both adhesive
      systems showed acceptable short-term clinical retention to dentin, which
      decreased after long-time in vivo aging, especially for the simplified
      etch-and-rinse system.

TI  - Allergic contact dermatitis from vitamin E: the experience at Mayo Clinic
      Arizona, 1987 to 2007.
PG  - 199-202
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin E, of which the most biologically active form is
      alpha-tocopherol, has become widely known for its antioxidant effects. It
      has been ingested or applied topically for purported anti-aging effects
      and for cosmetic enhancement. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the
      incidence of allergic contact dermatitis from vitamin E has increased in
      recent years. METHODS: With the approval of the Mayo Clinic institutional
      review board, we retrospectively analyzed patch-test data from patients
      tested from June 1987 through December 2007. RESULTS: A total of 2,950
      patients were patch-tested during this period, and 18 patients (0.61%) had
      positive reactions to alpha-tocopherol; 6 (0.53%) of 1,136 patients tested
      from June 1987 through December 1997 had positive results, and 12 (0.66%)
      of 1,814 patients tested from January 1998 through December 2007 had
      positive results (p = .69). CONCLUSION: Vitamin E appears to be a
      relatively rare contact allergen in our experience.

TI  - Supplementation with essential amino acids in middle age maintains the
      health of rat kidney.
PG  - 523-33
AB  - Chronic kidney diseases are a social and economic problem, and diet has
      long been recognized as a fundamental modulator of kidney health in human
      and experimental models. Age-dependent alterations in mitochondrial
      function play a crucial role in the development of diseases of aging, and
      mitochondrial disorders have been observed in experimental models of
      kidney failure. Recently, the beneficial dietary effect of a specific
      mixture of essential amino acids (EAA) has been studied in elderly
      subjects, but no data were collected from the kidney. The aim of this
      study was to assess whether daily supplementation of the diet with EAA at
      the beginning of senescence could preserve renal health. We used
      middle-aged (18-month-old) male Wistar rats fed a standard diet and water
      ad libitum (M-aged group) or a diet with added EAA (1.5 g/kg per day)
      dissolved in drinking water for 3 months (M-aged+EAA group). Young
      (2-month-old) rats fed a standard diet for 3 months were used as controls.
      Mitochondrial morphology and markers for collagen, cyt-c-oxidase, HSP60,
      GRP75, eNOS, iNOS, Bax, Bcl2 and VEGF were analyzed in glomeruli and
      tubules. EAA supplementation limited fibrosis and increased the capillary
      tuft area in the glomeruli of M-aged rats. VEGF and eNOS were enhanced in
      glomeruli and the peritubular space with the EAA-supplemented diet.
      Mitochondrial cyt-c oxidase, Bcl2, and chaperones increased in the distal
      tubules of the EAA group to levels similar to those observed in the young
      group. Mitochondrial area and density after EAA intake did not differ from
      young groups. The results suggest that prolonged EAA intake could
      represent a strategy for maintaining the healthy status of the kidney in
      M-aged animals.

TI  - Evidence-based criteria in the nutritional context.
PG  - 478-84
AB  - During the last decade, approaches to evidence-based medicine, with its
      heavy reliance on the randomized clinical trial (RCT), have been adapted
      to nutrition science and policy. However, there are distinct differences
      between the evidence that can be obtained for the testing of drugs using
      RCTs and those needed for the development of nutrient requirements or
      dietary guidelines. Although RCTs present one approach toward
      understanding the efficacy of nutrient interventions, the innate
      complexities of nutrient actions and interactions cannot always be
      adequately addressed through any single research design. Because of the
      limitations inherent in RCTs, particularly of nutrients, it is suggested
      that nutrient policy decisions will have to be made using the totality of
      the available evidence. This may mean action at a level of certainty that
      is different from what would be needed in the evaluation of drug efficacy.
      Similarly, it is judged that the level of confidence needed in defining
      nutrient requirements or dietary recommendations to prevent disease can be
      different from that needed to make recommendations to treat disease. In
      brief, advancing evidence-based nutrition will depend upon research
      approaches that include RCTs but go beyond them. Also necessary to this
      advance is the assessing, in future human studies, of covariates such as
      biomarkers of exposure and response, and the archiving of samples for
      future evaluation by emerging technologies.

TI  - Effects of growth and exercise on composition, structural maturation and
      appearance of osteoarthritis in articular cartilage of hamsters.
AB  - Abstract Articular cartilage composition and structure are maintained and
      remodeled by chondrocytes under the influence of loading. Exercise-induced
      changes in the composition, structure, mechanical properties and tissue
      integrity of growing and aging hamster articular cartilage were
      investigated. Articular cartilage samples (n = 191) were harvested from
      the proximal tibiae of hamsters aged 1, 3, 6, 12 and 15 months. The
      hamsters were divided into runners and controls. The runners had free
      access to a running wheel between 1 and 3 months (runner groups 3-, 12-
      and 15-month-old hamsters) or 1 and 6 months (runner group 6-month-old
      hamsters) of age. Control animals were subjected to a sedentary lifestyle.
      Mechanical indentation tests and depth-wise compositional and structural
      analyses were performed for the cartilage samples. Furthermore, the
      integrity of articular cartilage was assessed using histological
      osteoarthritis grading. Exercise affected the collagen network
      organization after a 5-month exercise period, especially in the middle and
      deep zones. However, no effect on the mechanical properties was detected
      after exercise. Before the age of 12 months, the runners showed less
      osteoarthritis than the controls, whereas at 15 months of age the
      situation was reversed. It is concluded that, in hamsters, physical
      exercise at a young age enhances cartilage maturation and alters the
      depth-wise cartilage structure and composition. This may be considered
      beneficial. However, exercise at a young age demonstrated adverse effects
      on cartilage at a later age with a significant increase in the incidence
      of osteoarthritis.

TI  - Conventional and Robust Quantitative Gait Norms in Community-Dwelling
      Older Adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and compare norms for widely used gait parameters
      in adults aged 70 and older using cross-sectional (conventional) and
      longitudinal (robust) approaches accounting for important confounders such
      as disease effects on gait. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: General
      community. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (&gt;70, N=824)
      without dementia or disability. MEASUREMENTS: Eight quantitative gait
      parameters measured using an instrumented walkway. RESULTS: Of the 824
      subjects (conventional normal (CN) sample), 304 were included in a "robust
      normal" (RN) sample after excluding those with prevalent or incident
      clinical gait abnormalities developing within 1 year of the baseline
      assessment to account for disease effects on gait performance.
      Descriptively, the RN sample showed better performance on all selected
      gait variables than the CN sample. For instance, mean gait velocity +/-
      standard deviation was 105.9 +/- 17.9 cm/s in the RN sample, compared with
      93.3 +/- 23.2 cm/s in the overall CN sample. Applying one standard
      deviation below the mean (70.1 cm/s) derived from the CN sample to define
      slow gait, 15.9% (131) in the overall cohort were classified as abnormal,
      whereas the RN cut-off (88.0 cm/s) classified 39.7% (327) in the overall
      cohort as abnormal. CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional conventional norms may
      underestimate gait performance in aging. Longitudinal robust norms provide
      more-accurate estimates of normal gait performance and thus may improve
      early detection of gait disorders in older adults.

TI  - Epigenetic profiles in primordial germ cells: global modulation and fine
      tuning of the epigenome for acquisition of totipotency.
PG  - 517-25
AB  - Germ cells, after fate determination as primordial germ cells (PGCs) in
      early embryos, undergo various unique changes in epigenetic status during
      their development, and these changes differ from the epigenetic changes
      occurring in any other somatic cells. For example, PGCs undergo
      demethylation of DNA and change histone modification states on a
      genome-wide scale. Although the full physiological significance of these
      epigenetic alterations is still unclear, we can now discuss some of their
      mechanisms due to recent experimental evidence demonstrating the
      expression of candidate molecules involved in the processes of epigenetic
      change. On the other hand, DNA demethylation associated with PGC-specific
      gene expression, reprogramming of imprinted genes and regulation of
      retrotransposons in PGCs differentially occur from the genome-wide DNA
      demethylation. The tendency of epigenetic changes to appear on the whole
      genome, as well as more precise changes in the epigenetic status of
      particular parts of the genome, may play important roles in establishing
      the properties of PGCs required for acquiring totipotency.

TI  - (11)C-Verapamil to Assess P-gp Function in Human Brain During Aging,
      Depression and Neurodegenerative Disease.
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions as an
      active efflux pump by extruding a wide range of substrates from the brain.
      This is important for maintaining loco-regional homeostasis and for
      protecting the brain against blood-borne toxic substances. Altered P-gp
      function seems to be involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative
      disease and various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Positron
      emission tomography (PET) with the radiotracer (11)C-verapamil (VPM-PET)
      is a validated technique allowing measurement of P-gp function at the
      human BBB. In this review, we highlight changes of P-gp function, as
      measured with VPM-PET, in aging and in the pathogenesis and progression of
      neurodegenerative disease, as well as their role in depressive disorders.

TI  - Curcumin Extends Life Span, Improves Health Span, and Modulates the
      Expression of Age-Associated Aging Genes in Drosophila melanogaster.
AB  - Abstract Background: Curcumin, an extract from the rhizome of the plant
      Curcuma longa (turmeric), has been widely used as a spice and herbal
      medicine in Asia. It has been suggested to have many biological
      activities, such as antioxidative, antiinflammatory, anticancer,
      chemopreventive, and antineurodegenerative properties. We evaluated the
      impact of curcumin on life span, fecundity, feeding rate, oxidative
      stress, locomotion, and gene expression in two different wild-type
      Drosophila melanogaster strains, Canton-S and Ives, under two different
      experimental conditions. Results: We report that curcumin extended the
      life span of two different strains of D. melanogaster, an effect that was
      accompanied by protection against oxidative stress, improvement in
      locomotion, and chemopreventive effects. Life span extension was gender
      and genotype specific. Curcumin also modulated the expression of several
      aging-related genes, including mth, thor, InR, and JNK. Conclusions: The
      observed positive effects of curcumin on life span and health span in two
      different D. melanogaster strains demonstrate a potential applicability of
      curcumin treatment in mammals. The ability of curcumin to mitigate the
      expression levels of age-associated genes in young flies suggests that the
      action of curcumin on these genes is a cause, rather than an effect, of
      its life span-extending effects.

TI  - Proteotoxicity and the Contrasting Effects of Oxaloacetate and Glycerol on
      Caenorhbditis elegans Life Span: A Role for Methylglyoxal?
AB  - Abstract Because accumulation of altered proteins is the most common
      biochemical symptom of aging, it is at least possible that such
      proteotoxicity may cause aging and influence life span. The life span of
      the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is strongly influenced by changes
      in the intracellular concentration of methylglyoxal (MG), a putative
      source of much age-related proteotoxicity and organelle, cellular, and
      molecular dysfunction. Glycerol has recently been shown to shorten,
      whereas oxaloacetate has been found to extend, life span in C. elegans. It
      is suggested here that glycerol and oxaloacetate exert opposing effects on
      MG formation in C. elegans. It is proposed that, if not secreted by
      aquaporin, glycerol is converted to glycerol phosphate and then to
      dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) via a reaction requiring nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). This inhibits operation of the glycerol
      phosphate cycle in which DHAP is converted into glycerol phosphate, which
      concomitantly regenerates NAD(+) from NADH, thereby ensuring glycolytic
      oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Because DHAP and G3P
      spontaneously decompose into MG, and NAD(+) is required for conversion of
      G3P into phosphoglycerate, the glycerol-induced increased DHAP formation
      and decreased NAD(+) availability will increase the potential for MG
      generation. In contrast, oxaloacetate may decrease MG generation by
      stimulating the operation of the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle, in which
      oxaloacetate is converted to malate, which regenerates NAD(+) from NADH.
      By the ensuing G3P oxidation, increased NAD(+) availability will decrease
      the potential for MG formation. It should be noted that mitochondria are
      involved in the operation of the above cycle/shuttles and that increased
      NAD(+) availability also stimulates those sirtuin activities that increase
      mitogenesis and mitochondrial activity via effects on signal transduction
      and gene expression, which frequently accompany dietary
      restriction-induced life span extension.

TI  - In vitro anti-aging activities of Terminalia chebula gall extract.
PG  - 469-81
AB  - CONTEXT: The Thai Lanna region has its own folklores and wisdoms in
      various fields such as traditional medicines. The galls of Terminalia
      chebula Retz. (Combretaceae) frequently appear in many Thai Lanna
      medicinal plant recipes for promoting longevity. OBJECTIVES: To
      investigate the in vitro anti-aging activities of the extracts from 15
      plants including T. chebula gall selected from the Thai medicinal plant
      recipes that have been traditionally used for longevity. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The plant extracts were prepared by four extraction methods
      including hot (HW) and cold (CW) aqueous processes and hot (HM) and cold
      (CM) methanol processes. These extracts were tested for antioxidative and
      tyrosinase inhibition activity as well as the proliferative and MMP-2
      inhibition activity on early aging human skin fibroblasts in order to
      evaluate their in vitro anti-aging activity. RESULTS: At 0.1 mg/mL, the CW
      extract of T. chebula gall exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging
      activity with scavenging of 84.64% +/- 2.22%, whereas ascorbic acid,
      alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxyl toluene gave 96.50% +/- 0.1%,
      35.74% +/- 0.2% and 27.43% +/- 0.1%, respectively. The CW extract of T.
      chebula gall indicated the highest stimulation index (SI) on normal human
      fibroblast proliferation of 1.441 which was more active than ascorbic acid
      (SI 1.21). This extract has also demonstrated MMP-2 inhibition on
      fibroblasts determined by zymography 1.37 times more potent than ascorbic
      acid. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed the traditional
      use of T. chebula gall in many Thai medicinal plant recipes for longevity
      which will be beneficial for further development of anti-aging products.

PG  - 1105-19
AB  - It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to
      optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition
      therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education
      are essential to the total system of health care available to people with
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of
      care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have
      stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to
      longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical
      and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities,
      wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related
      conditions further complicate disease management. With greater
      understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body
      function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations
      affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more
      complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and
      management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain
      significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care
      professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered,
      should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to
      optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV
      infection.

TI  - Lithiated Fluorinated Styrene Oxides: Configurational Stability, Synthetic
      Applications, and Mechanistic Insight.
AB  - The configurational stability of some lithiated fluorinated styrene oxides
      has been investigated. Chemical studies have shown that in ethereal
      solvents alpha-lithiated ortho-, meta-, and para-fluorostyrene oxides
      (2-Li, alpha-5-Li, and alpha-6-Li) are all configurationally stable in the
      reaction time scale, whereas alpha-lithiated ortho-, meta-, and
      para-trifluoromethylstyrene oxides (9-Li, 13-Li, and 14-Li) are
      configurationally unstable. Optically active oxiranyllithiums 2-Li and
      9-Li, could be stereospecifically generated and quenched with
      electrophiles. The corresponding derivatives were then successfully
      subjected to regiospecific ring-opening reactions with amines to give
      fluorinated beta-amino alcohols with a stereodefined quaternary carbinol
      center, which are useful synthons in medicinal chemistry. The barriers of
      inversion have been calculated (Eyring equation) for oxiranyllithiums
      9-Li, 13-Li, and 14-Li by determining the enantiomeric ratios after
      electrophilic quenching on aging the enantioenriched organolithium for
      different times in THF; in the case of 9-Li, activation parameters have
      also been determined. Mechanisms that may be responsible of the
      racemization oxiranyllithiums 9-Li, 13-Li, and 14-Li undergo once
      generated are also discussed.

TI  - Peroxynitrite-An ugly biofactor?
AB  - Cellular damage occurring under oxidative conditions has been ascribed
      mainly to the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOOH/ONOO(-)) that originates
      from the reaction of NO(*) with O(2) (*-). The detrimental effects of
      peroxynitrite are exacerbated by the reaction with CO(2) that leads to
      ONOOC(O)O(-), which further decays to the strong oxidant radicals NO(2)
      (*) and CO(3) (*-). The reaction with CO(2), however, may redirect
      peroxynitrite specificity. An excessive formation of peroxynitrite
      represents an important mechanism contributing to the DNA damage, the
      inactivation of metabolic enzymes, ionic pumps, and structural proteins,
      and the disruption of cell membranes. Because of its ability to oxidize
      biomolecules, peroxynitrite is implicated in an increasing list of
      diseases, including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders,
      inflammation, pain, autoimmunity, cancer, and aging. However,
      peroxynitrite displays also protective activities: (i) at high
      concentrations, it shows anti-viral, anti-microbial, and anti-parasitic
      actions; and (ii) at low concentrations, it stimulates protective
      mechanisms in the cardiovascular, nervous, and respiratory systems. The
      detrimental effects of peroxynitrite and related reactive species are
      impaired by (pseudo-) enzymatic systems, mainly represented by
      heme-proteins (e.g., hemoglobin and myoglobin). Here, we report
      biochemical aspects of peroxynitrite actions being at the root of its
      biomedical effects.

TI  - Joint modeling of missing data due to non-participation and death in
      longitudinal aging studies.
AB  - Specific age-related hypotheses are tested in population-based
      longitudinal studies. At specific time intervals, both the outcomes of
      interest and the time-varying covariates are measured. When participants
      are approached for follow-up, some participants do not provide data.
      Investigations may show that many have died before the time of follow-up
      whereas others refused to participate. Some of these non-participants do
      not provide data at later follow-ups. Few statistical methods for missing
      data distinguish between 'non-participation' and 'death' among study
      participants. The augmented inverse probability-weighted estimators are
      most commonly used in marginal structure models when data are missing at
      random. Treating non-participation and death as the same, however, may
      lead to biased estimates and invalid inferences. To overcome this
      limitation, a multiple inverse probability-weighted approach is presented
      to account for two types of missing data, non-participation and death,
      when using a marginal mean model. Under certain conditions, the multiple
      weighted estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Simulation
      studies will be used to study the finite sample efficiency of the multiple
      weighted estimators. The proposed method will be applied to study the risk
      factors associated with the cognitive decline among the aging adults,
      using data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP). Copyright (c)

TI  - Measurement of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha in biological fluids as a
      measure of lipid peroxidation.
PG  - 165-78
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that reactive oxygen species are
      implicated in human disease, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and
      restenosis after angioplasty. The measurement of F(2)-isoprostanes
      (F(2)-iPs), formed nonenzymatically through free radical catalyzed attack
      on esterified arachidonate, provides a reliable tool for identifying
      populations with enhanced rates of lipid peroxidation. Among F(2)-isoPs,
      8-iso-PGF(2alpha) (also referred to IPF(2alpha)-III) and IPF(2alpha)-VI
      are the most frequently measured in biological fluids. A variety of
      methods have been proposed to measure F(2)-isoprostanes in urine and
      plasma. Mass spectrometry has been developed for the measurement of both
      F(2)-isoprostanes but its use is limited as it is time-consuming and
      highly expensive. We have developed validated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and
      radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques using highly specific antisera for the
      measurement of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha). In contrast, the commercially available
      immunoassay kits are limited for their poor specificity. The measurement
      of specific isoprostanes, such as 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), in urine is a
      reliable, noninvasive index of lipid peroxidation that is of valuable help
      in dose-finding studies of natural and synthetic antioxidant agents.

TI  - Berries: Improving Human Health and Healthy Aging, and Promoting Quality
      Life-A Review.
AB  - The importance of the diet in relation to human health has increased the
      interest of consumers on nutraceuticals rich foods, and especially on
      fruits and vegetables. Berries are rich sources of a wide variety of
      antioxidant phenolics; these phytochemicals include flavonoids, stilbenes,
      tannins, and phenolic acids. Reactive oxidant species and free radicals
      are produced in an extensive range of physiological processes. In addition
      to the antioxidant defenses produced in the body, there are exogenous
      sources supplied by the diet; this is the case of berry fruits, among
      others. The insufficiency of antioxidant defense mechanisms is associated
      to the pathology of chronic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases,
      inflammation, and diabetes. Therefore, the enforcement of the latter
      mechanisms is of the utmost importance. The isolation and characterization
      of compounds that may delay the onset of aging is receiving intense
      research attention; some berry phenolics are being associated with this
      functional performance. Berry phenolics may also act as antimicrobials
      which may be of help in the control of the wild spectra of pathogens, in
      view of recent problems associated with antibiotic resistance. Most of the
      research works on the antioxidant activity of bioactive constituents of
      berries has been carried out using in vitro assays. In view of this, the
      human studies investigating the bioavailability and potential toxicity of
      phenolics are receiving more attention. Finally, we would like to
      emphasize the necessity of associating new plant breeding and genetic
      studies of berries with the expression and overexpression of compounds for
      human health and healthy aging.

TI  - Bacterial diversities on unaged and aging flue-cured tobacco leaves
      estimated by 16S rRNA sequence analysis.
AB  - Flue-cured tobacco leaves (FCTL) contain abundant bacteria, and these
      bacteria play very important roles in the tobacco aging process. However,
      bacterial communities on aging FCTL are not fully understood. In this
      study, the total microbial genome DNA of unaged and aging flue-cured
      tobacco K326 were isolated using a culture-independent method, and the
      bacterial communities were investigated by restriction fragment length
      polymorphism analysis. Comparison of the number of operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs) between the cloned libraries from the unaged and aging FCTL
      showed that the microbial communities between the two groups were
      different. Fifty and 42 OTUs were obtained from 300 positive clones in
      unaged and aging FCTL, respectively. Twenty-seven species of bacteria
      exist in both the unaged and aging FCTL, Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas
      spp. were two dominant genera in FCTL. However, 23 bacterial species were
      only identified from the unaged FCTL, while 15 species were only
      identified from the aging FCTL. Interestingly, more uncultured bacteria
      species were found in aging FCTL than in unaged FCTL.

TI  - Caveolin-1 as a Novel Indicator of Wound Healing Capacity in Aged Human
      Corneal Epithelium.
AB  - Excess caveolin-1 has been reported to play a role in age-dependent
      hyporesponsiveness to growth factors in vitro. We, therefore, hypothesize
      that caveolin-1-dependent hyporesponsiveness to growth factors in aged
      corneal epithelial cells might be responsible for delayed wound healing in
      vivo. In order to test this hypothesis, corneal wound healing time was
      evaluated by vital staining using fluorescein after laser epithelial
      keratomileusis (LASEK). We compared wound healing times in young, middle
      age, and elderly patients. We also examined caveolin-1 levels and other
      aging markers, such as p53 and p21, in the corneal epithelium. Elderly
      patients generally had higher caveolin-1 levels in the corneal epithelia
      than young patients. There were, however, variations among individuals
      with increased caveolin-1 in some young patients and decreased levels in
      some elderly patients. Wound healing time after LASEK correlated well with
      the corneal caveolin-1 status. Therefore, we suggest that caveloin-1
      status might be responsible for delayed wound healing in the elderly after
      LASEK. Caveolin-1 status might be a regulator for wound healing capacity
      and a novel target for in vivo adjustment.

TI  - The influence of perceptual training on working memory in older adults.
PG  - e11537
AB  - Normal aging is associated with a degradation of perceptual abilities and
      a decline in higher-level cognitive functions, notably working memory. To
      remediate age-related deficits, cognitive training programs are
      increasingly being developed. However, it is not yet definitively
      established if, and by what mechanisms, training ameliorates effects of
      cognitive aging. Furthermore, a major factor impeding the success of
      training programs is a frequent failure of training to transfer benefits
      to untrained abilities. Here, we offer the first evidence of direct
      transfer-of-benefits from perceptual discrimination training to working
      memory performance in older adults. Moreover, using electroencephalography
      to evaluate participants before and after training, we reveal neural
      evidence of functional plasticity in older adult brains, such that
      training-induced modifications in early visual processing during stimulus
      encoding predict working memory accuracy improvements. These findings
      demonstrate the strength of the perceptual discrimination training
      approach by offering clear psychophysical evidence of transfer-of-benefit
      and a neural mechanism underlying cognitive improvement.

TI  - Increased apoptosis of myoblasts in Drosophila model for the
      Walker-Warburg syndrome.
PG  - e11557
AB  - Walker-Warburg syndrome, a progressive muscular dystrophy, is a severe
      disease with various kinds of symptoms such as muscle weakness and
      occasional seizures. The genes of protein O-mannosyltransferases 1 and 2
      (POMT1 and POMT2), fukutin, and fukutin-related protein are responsible
      for this syndrome. In our previous study, we cloned Drosophila orthologs
      of human POMT1 and POMT2 and identified their activity. However, the
      mechanism of onset of this syndrome is not well understood. Furthermore,
      little is known about the behavioral properties of the Drosophila POMT1
      and POMT2 mutants, which are called rotated abdomen (rt) and twisted (tw),
      respectively. First, we performed various kinds of behavioral tests and
      described in detail the muscle structures by using these mutants. The
      mutant flies exhibited abnormalities in heavy exercises such as climbing
      or flight but not in light movements such as locomotion. Defective motor
      function in mutants appeared immediately after eclosion and was
      exaggerated with aging. Along with motor function, muscle ultrastructure
      in the tw mutant was altered, as seen in human patients. We demonstrated
      that expression of RNA interference (RNAi) for the rt gene and the tw
      mutant was almost completely lethal and semi-lethal, respectively. Flies
      expressing RNAi had reduced lifespans. These findings clearly demonstrate
      that Drosophila POMT mutants are models for human muscular dystrophy. We
      then observed a high density of myoblasts with an enhanced degree of
      apoptosis in the tw mutant, which completely lost enzymatic activity. In
      this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for the development of muscular
      dystrophy: POMT mutation causes high myoblast density and position
      derangement, which result in apoptosis, muscle disorganization, and muscle
      cell defects.

      aegypti. Minor costs of wMelPop-CLA infection for pre-imaginal
      survivorship, development and adult size were found. However, we
      discovered that the wMelPop-CLA infection dramatically decreased the
      viability of desiccated Ae. aegypti eggs over time. Similarly, the
      reproductive fitness of wMelPop-CLA infected Ae. aegypti females declined
      with age. These results reveal a general pattern associated with
      wMelPop-CLA induced pathogenesis in this mosquito species, where host
      fitness costs increase during aging of both immature and adult
      life-history stages. In addition to influencing the invasion dynamics of
      this particular Wolbachia strain, we suggest that the negative impact of
      wMelPop-CLA on embryonic quiescence may have applied utility as a tool to
      reduce mosquito population size in regions with pronounced dry seasons or
      in regions that experience cool winters.

      plasticity impairment on hippocampal slices.
LID - 10.3791/1884 [doi]
LID - 1884 [pii]
AB  - Impairment of synaptic connections is likely to underlie the subtle
      amnesic changes occurring at the early stages of Alzheimer s Disease (AD).
      beta-amyloid (A beta), a peptide produced in high amounts in AD, is known
      to reduce Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of learning
      and memory. Indeed, LTP impairment caused by A beta is a useful
      experimental paradigm for studying synaptic dysfunctions in AD models and
      for screening drugs capable of mitigating or reverting such synaptic
      impairments. Studies have shown that A beta produces the LTP disruption
      preferentially via its oligomeric form. Here we provide a detailed
      protocol for impairing LTP by perfusion of oligomerized synthetic A
      beta1-42 peptide onto acute hippocampal slices. In this video, we outline
      a step-by-step procedure for the preparation of oligomeric A beta(1-42;).
      Then, we follow an individual experiment in which LTP is reduced in
      hippocampal slices exposed to oligomerized A beta(1-42;) compared to
      slices in a control experiment where no A beta(1-42;) exposure had
      occurred.

TI  - Relationship between joint shape and the development of osteoarthritis.
PG  - 538-43
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present an updated summary of the relationship
      between joint shape and the development of osteoarthritis, with a
      particular focus on osteoarthritis of the hip. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Osteoarthritis of the hip is highly heritable, with a genetic contribution
      estimated at 60%. Among the genes that have been linked to this disease
      are several that are involved in the development and maintenance of joint
      shape, including members of the Wingless (Wnt) and the bone morphogenetic
      protein (BMP) family. Several features of hip joint architecture, such as
      acetabular dysplasia, pistol grip deformity, wide femoral neck, altered
      femoral neck-shaft angle, appear to play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and may predate the development of
      osteoarthritis by decades. SUMMARY: Gene-environment interactions play a
      crucial role in the development of osteoarthritis. The architecture of
      joint shape is determined by a complex sequence spanning embryonic,
      childhood, and adult life and contributes to the pathogenesis of
      osteoarthritis.

TI  - Should there be an expanded role for palliative care in end-stage renal
      disease?
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we outline the rationale for expanding
      the role of palliative care in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), describe
      the components of a palliative care model, and identify potential barriers
      in implementation. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients receiving chronic dialysis
      have reduced life expectancy and high rates of chronic pain, depression,
      cognitive impairment, and physical disability. Delivery of prognostic
      information and advance care planning are desired by patients, but occur
      infrequently. Furthermore, although hospice care is associated with
      improved symptom control and lower healthcare costs at the end of life, it
      is underutilized by the ESRD population, even among patients who withdraw
      from dialysis. A palliative care model incorporating communication of
      prognosis, advance care planning, symptom assessment and management, and
      timely hospice referral may improve quality of life and quality of dying.
      Resources and clinical practice guidelines are available to assist
      practitioners with incorporating palliative care into ESRD management.
      SUMMARY: There is a large unmet need to alleviate the physical,
      psychosocial, and existential suffering of patients with ESRD. More fully
      integrating palliative care into ESRD management by improving end-of-life
      care training, eliminating structural and financial barriers to hospice
      use, and identifying optimal methods to deliver palliative care are
      necessary if we are to successfully address the needs of an aging ESRD
      population.

TI  - Resveratrol Protects Human Endothelium from H(2)O(2)-Induced Oxidative
      Stress and Senescence via SirT1 Activation.
AB  - Aim: Silencing information regulator (SirT1), a NAD-dependent histone
      deacetylase, is an essential mediator of longevity in normal cells by
      calorie restriction. SirT1 has many biological functions, including
      transcription regulation, cell differentiation inhibition, cell cycle
      regulation, and anti-apoptosis. Resveratrol (RV)-induced SirT1 activation
      also improves endothelial dysfunction and suppresses vascular
      inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of RV-induced SirT1
      activation in endothelial cells under oxidative stress.Methods: SirT1 mRNA
      expression levels were examined in the endothelium layer (endothelial
      cells) of cardiac coronary vessels from patients receiving coronary artery
      bypass graft surgery (CABG) surgery and aged rats using reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To further explore the
      effect of SirT1 activation on oxidative stress-induced aging,
      senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) expression in
      RV-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with or without
      H(2)O(2) treatment was evaluated.Results: SirT1 expression was decreased
      in aged and atherosclerotic vessels in vivo, and significantly reduced in
      endothelial cells purified from vessel tissues. Furthermore, SirT1 levels
      were dose-dependently increased in RV-treated HUVECs. The SA-beta gal
      assay showed that RV inhibited the senescent phenotype of H(2)O(2)-treated
      HUVECs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the percentage of
      cells positive for SA-beta gal were significantly increased in siRNA-SirT1
      (knockdown of SirT1 expression)-treated HUVEC cells. Importantly, the
      treatment effect of RV was significantly abolished in the oxidative
      effects of H(2)O(2)-treated HUVECs by siRNA-SirT1.Conclusion: Our data
      suggested that SirT1 could be a crucial factor involved in the endothelial
      cells of atherosclerotic CAGB patients and aging rats. RV is a potential
      candidate for preventing oxidative stress-induced aging in endothelial
      cells. RV may also prevent ROS-induced damage via increased endothelial
      SirT1 expression.

TI  - Combined anchor suture with external upper eyelid blepharoplasty in asian
      patients.
PG  - 230-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of an anchor fixation stitch in combination
      with the external incision technique in Asian upper blepharoplasty.
      METHODS: Combined with an upper eyelid blepharoplasty using a conventional
      external incision procedure, an anchor stitch was used to fixate the
      dermal layer of the pretarsal skin and the upper edge of the tarsal plate.
      The procedure was performed in 72 patients with creaseless eyes (50 cases)
      or with laxity of the upper eyelids due to aging (22 cases). The patients
      were followed up for 6 to 12 months. The upper eyelid folds were evaluated
      by the surgeons and by the patients, and the outcome was graded as
      excellent, good, fair, or poor. RESULTS: Of the 72 patients, 52 (72%) had
      excellent results and 20 (28%) had good results; no patients had fair or
      poor results. There were no cases of crease loss after 6 to 12 months of
      follow-up. All patients were satisfied with the results. CONCLUSIONS: The
      findings show that the combined anchor suture with external surgery is a
      reliable approach to Asian upper eyelid blepharoplasty both in young
      creaseless eyelids and in eyelids with laxity due to aging. We suggest
      that the anchor suture could be used as a routine procedure in Asian
      blepharoplasty.

TI  - Impact of Age, Sex, and Comorbidity on Cancer Therapy and Disease
      Progression.
AB  - A theme of personalized medicine was highlighted at the 2009 Annual
      Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. To this end, the
      current review focuses on the impact of host characteristics (such as age,
      sex, and comorbidity) as they pertain to cancer biology, treatment
      efficacy, and tolerance. Increasing age is associated with complex changes
      in physiology, including alterations in renal and hepatic function, and
      decreased bone marrow reserve. These may in turn result in alterations in
      pharmacokinetics and toxicity related to many commonly used anticancer
      agents. Using tools, such as the geriatric assessment, may help to
      elucidate the physiologic age of the patient as opposed to the chronologic
      age. Increasing age is paralleled by an increase in comorbidity, and
      comorbidity may have independent prognostic implications and substantially
      impact medical decision making in the patient with cancer. Numerous
      biologic ties between cancer and comorbidity exist, one example being an
      association of diabetes with an increased risk of disease recurrence and
      mortality in the setting of colon cancer. Biologic features can also vary
      by sex; several biomarkers with either prognostic or predictive value (ie,
      excision-repair cross-complementation group 1 expression, epidermal growth
      factor receptor mutation, or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase polymorphism)
      may differentiate efficacy or toxicity in males and females. Taken
      together, age, sex, and comorbidity each encompass a complex array of
      physiologic and molecular variations that may each aid in personalizing
      care for the patient with cancer.

TI  - Alterations in the immuno-skeletal interface drive bone destruction in
      HIV-1 transgenic rats.
AB  - Osteoporosis and bone fractures are increasingly recognized complications
      of HIV-1 infection. Although antiretroviral therapy itself has complex
      effects on bone turnover, it is now evident that the majority of
      HIV-infected individuals already exhibit reduced bone mineral density
      before therapy. The mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial and
      have been difficult to delineate in humans. The HIV-1 transgenic rat
      recapitulates many key features of human AIDS. We now demonstrate that,
      like their human counterparts, HIV-1 transgenic rats undergo severe
      osteoclastic bone resorption, a consequence of an imbalance in the ratio
      of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand, the key osteoclastogenic
      cytokine, to that of its physiological decoy receptor osteoprotegerin.
      This imbalance stemmed from a switch in production of osteoprotegerin to
      that of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand by B cells, and was further
      compounded by a significantly elevated number of osteoclast precursors.
      With the advancing age of individuals living with HIV/AIDS, low bone
      mineral density associated with HIV infection is likely to collide with
      the pathophysiology of skeletal aging, leading to increased fracture risk.
      Understanding the mechanisms driving bone loss in HIV-infected individuals
      will be critical to developing effective therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Recovery of functional and structural age-related changes in the rat
      primary auditory cortex with operant training.
AB  - Cognitive decline is a virtually universal aspect of the aging process.
      However, its neurophysiological basis remains poorly understood. We
      describe here more than 20 age-related cortical processing deficits in the
      primary auditory cortex of aging versus young rats that appear to be
      strongly contributed to by altered cortical inhibition. Consistent with
      these changes, we recorded in old rats a decrease in parvalbumin-labeled
      inhibitory cortical neurons. Furthermore, old rats were slower to master a
      simple behavior, with learning progressions marked by more false-positive
      responses. We then examined the effect of intensive auditory training on
      the primary auditory cortex in these aged rats by using an oddball
      discrimination task. Following training, we found a nearly complete
      reversal of the majority of previously observed functional and structural
      cortical impairments. These findings suggest that age-related cognitive
      decline is a tightly regulated plastic process, and demonstrate that most
      of these age-related changes are, by their fundamental nature, reversible.

TI  - Predicting Utility for Joint Health States: A General Framework and a New
      Nonparametric Estimator.
AB  - Measuring utility is important in clinical decision making and
      cost-effectiveness analysis because utilities are often used to compute
      quality-adjusted life expectancy, a metric used in measuring the
      effectiveness of health care programs and medical interventions.
      Predicting utility for joint health states has become an increasingly
      valuable research topic because of the aging of the population and the
      increasing prevalence of comorbidities. Although multiplicative, minimum,
      and additive estimators are commonly used in practice, research has shown
      that they are all biased. In this study, the authors propose a general
      framework for predicting utility for joint health states. This framework
      includes these 3 nonparametric estimators as special cases. A new simple
      nonparametric estimator, the adjusted decrement estimator, [Uij = Umin -
      Umin(1 - Ui)(1 - Uj)], is introduced under the proposed framework. When
      applied to 2 independent data sources, the new nonparametric estimator not
      only generated unbiased prediction of utilities for joint health states
      but also had the least root mean squared error and highest concordance
      when compared with other nonparametric and parametric estimators. Further
      research and validation of this new estimator are needed.

TI  - Age and exposure to arsenic alter base excision repair transcript levels
      in mice.
AB  - Arsenic (As) induces DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species. Most oxidative
      DNA damage is countered by base excision repair (BER), the capacity for
      which may be reduced in older animals. We examined whether age and
      consumption of As in lactational milk or drinking water influences BER
      gene transcript levels in mice. Lactating mothers and 24-week-old mice
      were exposed (24 h or 2 weeks) to As (2 or 50 p.p.m.) in drinking water.
      Lung tissue was harvested from adults, neonates (initially 1 week old)
      feeding from lactating mothers and untreated animals 1-26 weeks old.
      Transcripts encoding BER proteins were quantified. BER transcript levels
      decreased precipitously with age in untreated mice but increased in
      neonates whose mothers were exposed to 50 p.p.m. As for 24 h or 2 weeks.
      Treatment of 24-week-old mice with 2 or 50 p.p.m. As for 2 weeks decreased
      all transcript levels measured. Exposure to As attenuated the age-related
      transcript level decline for only one BER gene. We conclude that aging is
      associated with a rapid reduction of BER transcript levels in mice, which
      may contribute to decreased BER activity in older animals. Levels of As
      that can alter gene expression are transmitted to neonatal mice in
      lactational milk produced by mothers drinking water containing As, raising
      concerns about breastfeeding in countries having As-contaminated
      groundwater. Reduction of BER transcript levels in 24-week-old mice
      exposed to As for 2 weeks suggests As may potentiate sensitivity to itself
      in older animals.

TI  - Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 Stimulates the Proliferation of
      Mesenchyme-Derived Progenitor Cells From Aging Mouse and Human Bone.
AB  - The potential of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) to stimulate
      osteoprogenitors in aging bone was investigated. Previous work showed a
      decrease in bone formation in cell cultures derived from bone of elderly
      female patients, but not in cells from age-matched male or younger female
      patients, with transforming growth factor beta increasing bone formation
      but not increasing osteoprogenitors. In the present study, FGF-2 was shown
      to significantly stimulate, in a dose-dependent manner, proliferation of
      mesenchyme-derived progenitor cells from bones of young and old mouse and
      humans. In proliferation assays, human cells were more responsive to lower
      concentrations (0.0016 ng/mL) of FGF-2 than mouse cells, but proliferation
      was less in cells from older bone. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
      that FGF-2 increased and prevented the decline in cells expressing
      activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, a novel marker for early
      lineage osteoblasts, but not alpha-smooth muscle actin. FGF-2 may have
      therapeutic potential for stimulating osteoblast progenitors in aging.

TI  - Comparisons of Plasma/Serum Micronutrients Between Okinawan and Oregonian
      Elders: A Pilot Study.
AB  - Certain micronutrients are protective against cognitive decline. We
      examined whether there is any uniform pattern of circulating
      micronutrients cross-culturally that are associated with successful
      cognitive aging. For the U.S. sample, we used the stored serum/plasma of
      115 participants, collected in Oregon, USA. The Okinawa sample consisted
      of 49 participants selected using similar inclusion criteria as the Oregon
      sample, from the Keys to Optimal Cognitive Aging Project. All participants
      were aged 85 years and older without cognitive impairment. We found that
      the Okinawan elders used fewer vitamin supplements but had similar levels
      of vitamin B(12) and alpha-tocopherol, lower folate and gamma-tocopherol,
      compared with Oregonian elders. That is, we did not find a uniform pattern
      of circulating micronutrients, suggesting that micronutrients other than
      those examined here or other lifestyle factors than nutrition could play
      an important role in achieving successful cognitive aging.

TI  - Secondary cleft rhinoplasty rejuvenates the nose: A suggestion from a
      panel survey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cleft-lip nasal deformity (CLND) affects the overall facial
      appearance and attractiveness. The CLND nose shares some features in part
      with the aging nose. OBJECTIVES: This questionnaire survey examined: 1)
      the panel perceptions of the role of secondary cleft rhinoplasty in nasal
      rejuvenation; and 2) the influence of a medical background in cleft care,
      age and gender of the panel members on the estimated age of the CLND nose.
      STUDY DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional study design, we enrolled a random
      sample of adult laypersons and health care providers. The predictor
      variables were secondary cleft rhinoplasty (before/after) and a medical
      background in cleft care (yes/no). The outcome variable was the estimated
      age of nose in photographs derived from 8 German nonsyndromic CLND
      patients. Other study variables included age, gender, and career of the
      assessors. Appropriate descriptive and univariate statistics were
      computed, and a P value of &lt;.05 was considered to be statistically
      significant. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 507 lay volunteers and 51
      medical experts (407 [72.9%] were female; mean age +/- SD = 24.9 +/- 8.2
      y). The estimated age of the CLND noses was higher than their real age.
      The rhinoplasty decreased the estimated age to a statistically significant
      degree (P &lt; .0001). A medical background, age, and gender of the
      participants were not individually associated with their votes (P &gt; .05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that CLND noses lack
      youthful appearance. Secondary cleft rhinoplasty rejuvenates the nose and
      makes it come close to the actual age of the patients.

TI  - Prevalence of Urinary Incontinence in Men: Results From the National
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
AB  - PURPOSE: We estimated the prevalence of urinary incontinence in the United
      States adult male population and identified associated factors. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Data were analyzed for 5,297 men 20 years old or older who
      participated in the 2005 to 2006 and 2007 to 2008 cycles of the National
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally
      representative survey of the United States noninstitutionalized
      population. Urinary incontinence (score of 3 or greater on a validated
      incontinence severity index, indicating moderate to severe leakage) was
      assessed. Potential associated factors included age, race/ethnicity,
      education, self-reported health status, prior diagnosis of prostate cancer
      and/or enlarged prostate (men 40 years old or older), chronic diseases and
      depression status. Prevalence ORs were estimated from a multivariable
      logistic regression analysis using appropriate sampling weights. RESULTS:
      The prevalence of moderate/severe urinary incontinence was 4.5% (95% CI
      3.8, 5.4). Prevalence increased with age from 0.7% (95% CI 0.4, 1.6) in
      men 20 to 34 years old, to 16.0% (95% CI 13.0, 19.4) in men 75 years old
      or older (p &lt;0.001). We found no difference in prevalence by racial/ethnic
      group (p = 0.38). Factors significantly associated (p &lt;0.05) with urinary
      incontinence were age (per 10-year increase, OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.6, 2.0),
      major depression (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.6, 4.0) and hypertension (OR 1.3; 95%
      CI 1.1, 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Age and race adjusted prevalence estimates for
      urinary incontinence in men are consistent with other estimates using a
      similar definition. To our knowledge this is the first study that
      identifies factors associated with moderate to severe urinary incontinence
      in men.

TI  - Initiating exercise training in late middle age minimally protects muscle
      contractile function and increases myocyte oxidative damage in senescent
      rats.
AB  - Age-related loss of muscle mass and function exhibits a marked
      acceleration from late middle age to senescence and exercise training is
      one method that has been proposed to slow this process. The purpose of
      this study was to determine if long-term treadmill exercise training
      initiated at late middle age could increase endogenous antioxidant enzyme
      activity and attenuate the loss of skeletal muscle contractile properties
      in the gastrocnemius/plantaris (GAS/Plan) and soleus (SOL) muscles of
      senescent rats (34-36mo) through a decrease in oxidative damage. Male
      Fisher 344 x Brown Norway F1-hybrid rats underwent 5-7mo of treadmill
      training beginning at late middle age (29mo). A 7mo sedentary adult group
      was used to investigate age-related changes. Aging caused an increase in
      antioxidant enzyme activities; however, only SOD activity was further
      increased with exercise training. Exercise training did not attenuate the
      decrease in twitch or tetanic tension of the GAS/Plan or SOL. It did,
      however, prevent the increase in twitch half relaxation time of the SOL
      muscle only. Oxidative damage, as reflected in carbonyl content, was
      increased with age and even further with exercise training in the GAS
      muscle. Muscle fibre cross sectional area was decreased with age and even
      further with exercise training. Interestingly, small muscle fibres showed
      the highest accumulation of carbonyls. Overall, despite an augmentation of
      select antioxidant enzyme activities, exercise training from late middle
      age through to senescence had minimal benefits for muscle contractile
      properties, perhaps in part due to exacerbated oxidation.

TI  - Evolution of the rate of biological aging using a phenotype based
      computational model.
AB  - In this work I introduce a simple model to study how natural selection
      acts upon aging, which focuses on the viability of each individual. It is
      able to reproduce the Gompertz law of mortality and can make predictions
      about the relation between the level of mutation rates
      (beneficial/deleterious/neutral), age at reproductive maturity and the
      degree of biological aging. With no mutations, a population with low age
      at reproductive maturity R stabilizes at higher density values, while with
      mutations it reaches its maximum density, because even for large
      pre-reproductive periods each individual evolves to survive to maturity.
      Species with very short pre-reproductive periods can only tolerate a small
      number of detrimental mutations. The probabilities of detrimental (P(d))
      or beneficial (P(b)) mutations are demonstrated to greatly affect the
      process. High absolute values produce peaks in the viability of the
      population over time. Mutations combined with low selection pressure move
      the system towards weaker phenotypes. For low values in the ratio
      P(d)/P(b), the speed at which aging occurs is almost independent of R,
      while higher values favor significantly species with high R. The value of
      R is critical to whether the population survives or dies out. The aging
      rate is controlled by P(d) and P(b) and the amount of the viability of
      each individual is modified, with neutral mutations allowing the system
      more "room" to evolve. The process of aging in this simple model is
      revealed to be fairly complex, yielding a rich variety of results.

TI  - Klotho inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in human lung cancer cell
      line A549.
PG  - 99
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Klotho, as a new anti-aging gene, can shed into
      circulation and act as a multi-functional humoral factor that influences
      multiple biological processes. Recently, published studies suggest that
      klotho can also serve as a potential tumor suppressor. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of action of
      klotho in human lung cancer cell line A549. METHODS: In this study,
      plasmids encoding klotho or klotho specific shRNAs were constructed to
      overexpress or knockdown klotho in vitro. A549 cells were respectively
      treated with pCMV6-MYC-KL or klotho specific shRNAs. The MTT assay was
      used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of klotho and flow cytometry was
      utilized to observe and detect the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by
      klotho. The activation of IGF-1/insulin signal pathways in A549 cells
      treated by pCMV6-MYC-KL or shRNAs were evaluated by western blotting. The
      expression levels of bcl-2 and bax transcripts were evaluated by
      quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
      RESULTS: Overexpression of klotho reduced the proliferation of lung cancer
      A549 cells, whereas klotho silencing in A549 cells enhanced proliferation.
      Klotho did not show any effects on HEK-293 cells. Klotho overexpression in
      A549 cells was associated with reduced IGF-1/insulin-induced
      phosphorylation of IGF-1R (IGF-1 receptor)/IR (insulin receptor) (P&lt;0.01).
      Overexpression of klotho can promote the apoptosis of A549 cells (P&lt;0.01).
      Overexpression of klotho, a bcl family gene bax, was found up-regulated
      and bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis gene, was found down-regulated (P&lt;0.01). In
      contrast, bax and bcl-2 were found down-regulated (P&lt;0.05) and
      up-regulated (P&lt;0.01), respectively when silencing klotho using shRNAs.
      CONCLUSIONS: Klotho can inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis of
      A549 cells, this may be partly due to the inhibition of IGF-1/insulin
      pathways and involving regulating the expression of the apoptosis-related
      genes bax/bcl-2. Thus, klotho can serve as a potential tumor suppressor in
      A549 cells.

TI  - Sex specific effects of habitual aerobic exercise on brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation in middle-aged and older adults.
AB  - Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is impaired with aging and is
      associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We
      determined if regular aerobic exercise improves brachial artery FMD in
      middle-aged/older (MA/O) men and postmenopausal women. In sedentary MA/O
      adults (age 55 - 79 years) without CVD, 8 weeks of brisk walking (6
      days/week for ~50 min/day; randomized, controlled design) increased
      treadmill time ~20% in both MA/O men (n=11) and postmenopausal women
      (n=15) (P&lt;0.01), without altering body composition or circulating CVD risk
      factors. Brachial artery FMD increased &lt; 50% in the MA/O men (4.6 +/- 0.6
      to 7.1 +/- 0.6%, P &lt; 0.01), but did not change in the postmenopausal women
      (5.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.7%, P = 0.50). No changes occurred in the
      non-exercising controls. In a separate cross-sectional study (n =167),
      brachial artery FMD was ~50% greater in endurance exercise-trained (6.4
      +/- 0.4%, n = 45) vs. sedentary (4.3 +/- 0.3%, n = 60) MA/O men (P &lt;
      0.001), whereas there were no differences between endurance-trained (5.3
      +/- 0.7%, n = 20) and sedentary (5.6 +/- 0.5%, n = 42) postmenopausal
      women (P = 0.70). Brachial artery lumen diameter, peak hyperemic shear
      rate and endothelium-independent dilation did not differ with exercise
      intervention or in the endurance-exercise vs. sedentary groups. Regular
      aerobic exercise is consistently associated with enhanced brachial artery
      FMD in MA/O men, but not in postmenopausal women. Some postmenopausal
      women without CVD may be less responsive to habitual aerobic exercise than
      MA/O men.

TI  - Non-standard vision measures predict mortality in elders: the
      Smith-Kettlewell Institute (SKI) study.
PG  - 242-50
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine which vision tests predict mortality within 10 years
      in a community-based elderly sample. METHODS: Nine hundred residents of
      Marin County, California 58 to 101 years of age (mean 75 years at
      baseline), underwent a battery of tests, including high contrast acuity,
      low contrast acuity, low contrast/low luminance acuity, acuity in glare,
      contrast sensitivity, color vision, stereopsis, standard and attentional
      fields. The association between the vision tests and mortality within 10
      years of baseline was assessed with Cox Proportional Hazards models
      controlling for age, sex, education level, depression, cognitive status
      and self-reported medical conditions. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of the
      sample died within 10 years of baseline. When controlling for
      mortality-related covariates, impairment in any of the vision measures was
      associated with increased risk of death. However, non-standard vision
      measures (ie, impairment in low contrast/low luminance acuity, standard
      field integrity and the impact of the attentional task on field integrity)
      were more highly associated with mortality than standard high contrast
      acuity. CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with other studies, we find that visual
      impairment is a significant predictor of death. However, the strongest
      relationship was found for measures other than high contrast acuity. These
      results suggest that non-standard vision measures may be more sensitive
      indicators of generalized aging in the most elderly.

PG  - 476-81
AB  - This qualitative case study is part of another study: Aging, health and
      work. The objective of this excerpt was to identify the meaning of aging
      on the streets for the elderly living on the street. The subjects'
      statements were analyzed under the light of the following themes: history
      of aging and history of life on the streets. It was understood that the
      streets are usually a hostile environment for the elderly. It does not
      guarantee the basic life conditions, affecting the mental health of people
      who are forced to live on the streets, particularly the elderly. The
      street does not offer any way out and, together with to the life
      conditions of the elderly living on the streets leads to the gradual loss
      of self-esteem, significantly affecting self-care. In addition to these
      issues, we found that compromised functional capacity puts the
      life/survival of the elderly living on the streets at risk.

PG  - 407-12
AB  - The objective of the present study was to identify and analyze the meaning
      of old age and the experience of aging for elderly individuals living in
      the rural area of Ceara state. This descriptive, exploratory study was
      performed with 48 aged men and women, registered in the family health
      strategy of the rural zone of Ceara, in the first semester of 2005. The
      statements of the elderly revealed that old age brings many losses, mainly
      when they fall ill. They also reported, however, that, today, they are
      happy for the personal and material achievements, and for the family that
      they have. For the study group, the experience of aging and old age itself
      appeared to be a positive event when compared to myths and preconceptions
      of the urban environment.

TI  - Polarity in Stem Cells, Disease and Aging.
AB  - Adult somatic stem cells are central to homeostasis in tissues that
      present with a high cellular turnover like the skin, intestine and the
      hematopoietic system. It is thought that polarity is particularly
      important with respect to fate decisions upon stem cell division
      (symmetric or asymmetric) as well as for the maintenance of stem cell
      adhesion and quiescence (interaction with the niche [1-3]. Consequently
      the failure to establish or regulate stem cell polarity might result in
      disease or tissue attrition [4-6]. Members of the family of small
      RhoGTPases are known to exert an important role in regulating cell
      polarity [7]. We summarize and discuss here recent views on the role of
      cell polarity in somatic stem cell function, aging and disease, concluding
      that targeting cell polarity might be a novel approach to ameliorate or
      even revert aberrant somatic stem cell function [8, 9].

TI  - [Diuretics-related complications in elderly patients]
PG  - 276-80
AB  - Diuretics are well studied and evaluated for their beneficial use in
      geriatric patients. However those drugs are often used without taking care
      of subjects condition or functional impairment. Known side effects of
      those substances may be increased by combinations of multiple drugs.
      Polypharmacy is a strong risk factor for the incidence of adverse drug
      reactions (ADR). ADRs are frequently found in combination with the use of
      diuretics. The remodelling of human body in aging process and uncontrolled
      therapeutic strategies seem to be causal for that finding. This article
      tries to work out the potential risk of the usage of those drugs in
      geriatric patients and its clinical relevance by using literature
      published in PubMed.

TI  - Redundant and unique roles of coronin proteins in Dictyostelium.
AB  - Dictyostelium discoideum harbors a short (CRN12) and a long coronin (CRN7)
      composed of one and two beta-propellers, respectively. They are primarily
      present in the cell cortex and cells lacking CRN12 (corA (-)) or CRN7
      (corB (-)) have defects in actin driven processes. We compared the
      characteristics of a mutant cell line (corA (-) /corB (-)) lacking CRN12
      and CRN7 with the single mutants focusing on cytokinesis, phagocytosis,
      chemotaxis and development. Cytokinesis, uptake of small particles, and
      developmental defects were not enhanced in the corA (-) /corB (-) strain
      as compared to the single mutants, whereas motility and phagocytosis of
      yeast particles were more severely impaired. It appears that although both
      proteins affect the same processes they do not act in a redundant manner.
      Rather, they often act antagonistically, which is in accordance with their
      proposed roles in the actin cytoskeleton where CRN12 acts in actin
      disassembly whereas CRN7 stabilizes actin filaments and protects them from
      disassembly.

TI  - Differential effects of age and executive functions on the resolution of
      the contingent negative variation: a reexamination of the frontal aging
      theory.
AB  - The "frontal aging theory" assumes the deterioration of
      executive/inhibitory functions as causal factors for the cognitive decline
      in human aging. The contingent negative variation resolution (CNV-R) is an
      electroencephalographic potential elicited after the second (informative)
      stimulus in warned Go/NoGo tasks requiring a response to one type of
      stimulus (Go) but not to the other (NoGo). Whereas the CNV-R across
      conditions is a measure of executive functions, the augmented potential in
      the NoGo condition is a specific measure of inhibitory processes. The aim
      was to examine the presumed linkage between executive processes and the
      CNV-R with special regard to inhibition in the NoGo condition, and to test
      whether any effects of age on this potential can be explained by a failure
      of (inhibitory) executive functions. Nineteen young and 15 elderly
      non-demented healthy volunteers were examined in a Go/NoGo CNV-R paradigm
      and on a test of executive functions focussed on set shifting (Trail
      Making test). Results showed: (1) Better executive functions are
      associated with higher amplitudes of the CNV-R across conditions. (2) The
      CNV-R is higher for elderly than younger subjects; this increment is much
      stronger in the NoGo condition. In conclusion, the CNV-R across conditions
      reflects executive processes such as the shift of motor set. A higher
      CNV-R for elderly subjects (particularly of the inhibition-related NoGo
      CNV-R) indicates that this group is not impaired in the available amount
      of executive control but may exert such control for task demands where
      young subjects do not require it.

TI  - A novel, population-specific approach to define frailty.
AB  - The description of frailty, a syndrome of the elderly due to the decline
      of homeostatic capacities, has opened new opportunities in the study of
      the biological basis of human aging. However, the noticeable heterogeneity
      for this trait in different geographic areas makes it difficult to use
      standardized methods for measuring the quality of aging in different
      populations. Consequently, the necessity to carry out population-specific
      surveys to define tools which are able to highlight groups of subjects
      with homogeneous aging phenotype within each population has emerged. We
      carried out an extensive monitoring of the status of the elderly
      population in Calabria, southern Italy, performing a geriatric
      multidimensional evaluation of 680 subjects (age range 65-108 years).
      Then, in order to classify the subjects, we applied a cluster analysis
      which considered physical, cognitive, and psychological parameters such as
      classification variables. We identified groups of subjects homogeneous for
      the aging phenotypes. The diagnostic and predictive soundness of our
      classification was confirmed by a 3-year longitudinal study. In fact, both
      Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions and Cox proportional
      hazard models indicate higher survival chance for subjects characterized
      by lower frailty. The availability of operative frailty phenotypes allows
      a reappraisal of the biological basis of healthy aging as it regards both
      biomarkers correlated with the frail phenotype and the genetic variability
      associated with the phenotypes identified. Indeed, we found that the
      frailty phenotype is strongly correlated with clinical parameters
      associated with the nutritional status.

      and metabolism, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a glia
      specific marker, increase with age in rodents. In this study, we assessed
      whether these four proteins show similar age-related changes in a nonhuman
      primate, the rhesus macaque. Free-floating sections from the PFC and
      hippocampus from adult, middle-aged, and aged rhesus macaques were
      immunohistochemically labeled for MAP-2, SYN, apoE, and GFAP. Protein
      levels were measured as area occupied by fluorescence using confocal
      microscopy as well as by Western blot. In the PFC and hippocampus of adult
      and middle-aged animals, the levels of SYN, apoE, and GFAP
      immunoreactivity were comparable but there was a trend towards higher
      MAP-2 levels in middle-aged than adult animals. There was significantly
      less SYN and more MAP-2, apoE, and GFAP immunoreactivity in the PFC and
      hippocampus of aged animals compared to adult or middle-aged animals.
      Thus, the age-related changes in MAP-2, apoE, and GFAP levels were similar
      to those previously observed in rodents. On the other hand, the
      age-related changes in SYN levels were not, but were similar to those
      previously observed in the aging human brain. Taken together, these data
      emphasize the value of the rhesus macaque as a pragmatic translational
      model for human brain aging.

TI  - Influence of aerobic fitness on age-related lymphocyte DNA damage in
      humans: relationship with mitochondria respiratory chain and hydrogen
      peroxide production.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of aerobic fitness (AF)
      on age-related lymphocyte DNA damage in humans, giving special attention
      to the role of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and hydrogen peroxide
      production. Considering age and AF (as assessed by VO(2)max), 66 males
      (19-59 years old) were classified as high fitness (HF) or low fitness (LF)
      and distributed into one of the following groups: young adults (19-29
      years old), adults (30-39 years old), and middle-aged adults (over 40
      years old). Peripheral lymphocytes obtained at rest were used to assess
      DNA damage (strand breaks and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG)
      sites through the comet assay), activity of mitochondrial complexes I and
      II (polarographically measured), and the hydrogen peroxide production rate
      (assayed by fluorescence). Results revealed a significant interaction
      between age groups and AF for DNA strand breaks (F = 8.415, p = .000), FPG
      sites (F = 11.766, p = .000), mitochondrial complex I activity (F = 7.555,
      p = .000), and H(2)O(2) production (F = 7.500, p = .000). Except for
      mitochondrial complex II activity, the age variation of the remaining
      parameters was significantly attenuated by HF. Considering each AF level,
      an increase in DNA strand breaks and FPG sites with age (r = 0.655, p =
      0.000, and r = 0.738, p = 0.000, respectively) was only observed in LF.
      Moreover, decreased mitochondrial complex I activity with age (r = -.470,
      p = .009) was reported in LF. These results allow the conclusion that high
      AF seems to play a key role in attenuating the biological aging process.

TI  - Power training and postmenopausal hormone therapy affect transcriptional
      control of specific co-regulated gene clusters in skeletal muscle.
AB  - At the moment, there is no clear molecular explanation for the steeper
      decline in muscle performance after menopause or the mechanisms of
      counteractive treatments. The goal of this genome-wide study was to
      identify the genes and gene clusters through which power training (PT)
      comprising jumping activities or estrogen containing hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) may affect skeletal muscle properties after menopause. We
      used musculus vastus lateralis samples from early stage postmenopausal
      (50-57 years old) women participating in a yearlong randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial with PT and HRT interventions. Using
      microarray platform with over 24,000 probes, we identified 665
      differentially expressed genes. The hierarchical clustering method was
      used to assort the genes. Additionally, enrichment analysis of gene
      ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
      pathways was carried out to clarify whether assorted gene clusters are
      enriched with particular functional categories. The analysis revealed
      transcriptional regulation of 49 GO/KEGG categories. PT upregulated
      transcription in "response to contraction"-category revealing novel
      candidate genes for contraction-related regulation of muscle function
      while HRT upregulated gene expression related to functionality of
      mitochondria. Moreover, several functional categories tightly related to
      muscle energy metabolism, development, and function were affected
      regardless of the treatment. Our results emphasize that during the early
      stages of the postmenopause, muscle properties are under transcriptional
      modulation, which both PT and HRT partially counteract leading to
      preservation of muscle power and potentially reducing the risk for
      aging-related muscle weakness. More specifically, PT and HRT may function
      through improving energy metabolism, response to contraction as well as by
      preserving functionality of the mitochondria.

TI  - Semantic representation and naming in children with specific language
      impairment.
PG  - 113-8
LID - S0104-56872010000200008 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) show lexical
      deficits as the first noticeable sign of such disorder, characterized as
      difficulties in lexical access during naming and speech tests. Studies
      that compare picture naming and drawings seem perfect to clarify lexical
      deficits. AIM: to compare the performance of children with normal language
      development (NLD) to that of children with SLI in naming, drawing and
      definition tasks, aiming to explore the the quality of semantic
      representation of the lexicon. METHOD: Two groups were involved in this
      study: the Control Group (CG), with no language disorders, composed by 40
      subjects, and the Research Group (RG), with 20 subjects, all diagnosed
      with SLI, aging from five to seven years. Tasks of naming, picture drawing
      and definition were performed, using 20 different pictures. In the naming
      task, the types of errors were analyzed and sorted as follows: semantic,
      phonological, none specified and others. The analysis of the drawing and
      definition tasks was based only on the correct answers, semantic and none
      specified errors. RESULTS: children of the RG presented a greater number
      of semantic errors in the picture naming task when compared to the CG.
      Besides that, definitions presented by the RG seemed more simple and
      incomplete even when the child was capable of naming the picture
      correctly. Drawings of correctly named objects were better than those that
      were named incorrectly. CONCLUSIONS: it was possible to discriminate
      within SLI children those that present greater lexical deficits. It was
      also possible to explore the possible reasons for failures in naming
      tasks.

TI  - Quasi-drugs developed in Japan for the prevention or treatment of
      hyperpigmentary disorders.
PG  - 2566-75
AB  - Excess production of melanin or its abnormal distribution, or both, can
      cause irregular hyperpigmentation of the skin, leading to melasma and age
      spots. To date, various quasi-drugs that prevent or improve
      hyperpigmentary disorders have been developed and officially approved by
      the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan. Many of these inhibit
      the activity of tyrosinase, an enzyme required for melanin synthesis, for
      example, by competitive or non-competitive inhibition of its catalytic
      activity, by inhibiting its maturation, or by accelerating its
      degradation. In this review, we categorize the quasi-drugs developed in
      Japan to prevent or treat hyperpigmentary disorders, or both, and discuss
      perspectives for future development.

TI  - Skin color independent assessment of aging using skin autofluorescence.
PG  - 14416-29

AB  - Skin autofluorescence (AF) for the non-invasive assessment of the amount
      of accumulated tissue Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) increases with
      aging. In subjects with darker skin colors, measurements typically result
      in lower AF values than in subjects with fair skin colors, e.g. due to
      selective absorption by skin compounds. Our aim was to provide a new
      method for calculating skin AF, yielding values that are independent of
      skin color. The deviation of skin AF of healthy subjects with various
      darker skin types (N = 99) compared to reference values from Caucasians
      showed to be a function of various parameters that were derived from
      reflectance and emission spectra in the UV and visible range (adjusted
      R(2) = 80%). Validation of the new algorithm, based on these findings, in
      a separate dataset (N = 141) showed that results of skin AF can now be
      obtained to assess skin AGEs independently of skin color.

TI  - Making longevity in an aging society: linking Medicare policy and the new
      ethical field.
PG  - 407-24
AB  - Life-extending interventions for older persons are changing medical
      knowledge and societal expectations about longevity. Today's consciousness
      about growing older is partly shaped by a new form of ethics, constituted
      by and enabled through the routines and institutions that comprise
      ordinary clinical care. Unlike bioethics, whose emphasis is on clinical
      decision-making in individual situations, this new form of ethics is
      exceptionally diffuse and can be characterized as an ethical field. It is
      located in and shaped by health-care policies, standard technologies, and
      clinical evidence, and it emerges in what patients and families come to
      need and want. Three developments illustrate this ethical field at work:
      the changing nature of disease, especially the ascent of risk awareness
      and risk-based strategies for life extension; the role of technology in
      reshaping the ends of medicine; and the role of Medicare policy in
      creating need and ethical necessity. Medicare's expanding criteria for
      payment coverage of liver transplantation and implantable cardiac devices
      illustrate the pervasive logic of this new form of ethics. The powerful
      connection between the technological imperative and its ethical necessity
      is rarely mentioned in Medicare reform debates.

TI  - Fanconi anemia Group J mutation abolishes its DNA repair function by
      uncoupling DNA translocation from helicase activity or disruption of
      protein-DNA complexes.
AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease characterized by congenital
      abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to leukemia and
      other cancers. FANCJ, one of thirteen genes linked to FA, encodes a DNA
      helicase proposed to operate in homologous recombination repair and
      replicational stress response. The pathogenic FANCJ-A349P amino acid
      substitution resides immediately adjacent to a highly conserved cysteine
      of the Iron-Sulfur domain. Given the genetic linkage of the FANCJ-A349P
      allele to FA, we investigated the effect of this particular mutation on
      the biochemical and cellular functions of the FANCJ protein. Purified
      recombinant FANCJ-A349P protein had reduced iron and was defective in
      coupling ATP hydrolysis and translocase activity to unwinding forked
      duplex or G-quadruplex DNA substrates or disrupting protein-DNA complexes.
      The FANCJ-A349P allele failed to rescue cisplatin or telomestatin
      sensitivity of a FA-J null cell line as detected by cell survival or
      gamma-H2AX foci formation. Furthermore, expression of FANCJ-A349P in a
      wild-type background exerted a dominant negative effect, indicating that
      the mutant protein interferes with normal DNA metabolism. The ability of
      FANCJ to use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to produce the force required
      to unwind DNA or destabilize protein bound to DNA is required for its role
      in DNA repair.

TI  - No Evidence for Shorter Leukocyte Telomere Length in Parkinson's Disease
      Patients.
AB  - Telomeres constitute the protective ends of chromosomes. They become
      shorter after each cell division, and therefore, telomere length is
      considered as an indicator of cellular aging. Interestingly, both
      inflammation and oxidative stress, which play a role in the etiology of
      Parkinson's disease (PD), may accelerate telomere shortening. Furthermore,
      it has been suggested that leukocyte telomere shortening may be
      accelerated in PD. To replicate the earlier findings, we analyzed telomere
      length of peripheral blood leukocytes in a sample of 131 PD patients (aged
      66.8 +/- 9.7 years) and 115 controls (aged 65.4 +/- 9.8 years) from
      Finland. As expected, age associated significantly with telomere length (p
      = .01). However, telomere length did not differ significantly between PD
      patients and controls (p = .54). Furthermore, extremely short telomeres
      were not more frequent in PD patients than in controls, as suggested in an
      earlier study. Our results do not support the concept of accelerated
      leukocyte telomere shortening in PD.

TI  - Solvent accessibility of betaB2-crystallin and local structural changes
      due to deamidation at the dimer interface.
AB  - In the lens of the eye the ordered arrangement of the major proteins, the
      crystallins, contributes to lens transparency. Members of the
      beta/gamma-crystallin family share common beta-sheet rich domains and
      hydrophobic regions at the monomer-monomer or domain-domain interfaces.
      Disruption of these interfaces, due to post-translational modifications,
      such as deamidation, decreases the stability of the crystallins. Previous
      experiments have failed to define the structural changes associated with
      this decreased stability. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange with mass
      spectrometry (HDMS), deamidation-induced local structural changes in
      betaB2-crystallin were identified. Deamidation was mimicked by replacing
      glutamines with glutamic acids at homologous residues 70 and 162 in the
      monomer-monomer interface of the betaB2-crystallin dimer. The exchange-in
      of deuterium was determined from 15 s to 24 h and the global and local
      changes in solvent accessibility were measured. In the wild type
      betaB2-crystallin (WT), only about 20% of the backbone amide hydrogen was
      exchanged, suggesting an overall low accessibility of betaB2-crystallin in
      solution. This is consistent with a tightly packed domain structure
      observed in the crystal structure. Deuterium levels were initially greater
      in N-terminal domain (N-td) peptides than in homologous peptides in the
      C-terminal domain (C-td). The more rapid incorporation suggests a greater
      solvent accessibility of the N-td. In the betaB2-crystallin crystal
      structure, interface Gln are oriented towards their opposite domain. When
      deamidation was mimicked at Gln70 in the N-td, deuterium levels increased
      at the interface peptide in the C-td. A similar effect in the N-td was not
      observed when deamidation was mimicked at the homologous residue, Gln162,
      in the C-td. This difference in the mutants can be explained by
      deamidation at Gln70 disrupting the more compact C-td and increasing the
      solvent accessibility in the C-td interface peptides. When deamidation was
      mimicked at both interface Gln, deuterium incorporation increased in the
      C-td, similar to deamidation at Gln70 alone. In addition, deuterium
      incorporation was decreased in the N-td in an outside loop peptide
      adjacent to the mutation site. This decreased accessibility may be due to
      newly exposed charge groups facilitating ionic interactions or to peptides
      becoming more buried when other regions became more exposed. The highly
      sensitive HDMS methods used here detected local structural changes in
      solution that had not been previously identified and provide a mechanism
      for the associated decrease in stability due to deamidation. Changes in
      accessibility due to deamidation at the interface led to structural
      perturbations elsewhere in the protein. The cumulative effects of multiple
      deamidation sites perturbing the structure both locally and distant from
      the site of deamidation may contribute to aggregation and precipitation
      during aging and cataractogenesis in the lens.

TI  - Differential inflammatory responses in aging and disease: TNF-alpha and
      IL-6 as possible biomarkers.
PG  - 733-737
AB  - Oxidative stress has been reported to increase during aging and conditions
      of hypoxia. Although low oxygen saturation has a key role in the
      development of several age-related diseases, the underlying mechanisms are
      still unknown. We analyzed the relationship between aging and hypoxia by
      examining oxidative stress and inflammation-related cytokines. We
      collected blood samples from three volunteer experimental groups,
      consisting of one group of normoxic middle-aged people and two groups of
      individuals older than 75years, which comprised a subgroup of normoxic
      subjects and another with oxyhemoglobin saturation lower than 95%
      (hypoxic). Our results showed a fall in antioxidant defenses in older
      people with hypoxia. TNF-alpha, the first element in the cytokine cascade,
      was significantly increased in the aged population, implying that aging is
      accompanied by a gradual increase in this inflammatory biomarker. IL-6 was
      not associated with aging, but it was highly elevated under hypoxia
      conditions in elderly subjects. Thus, these parameters could be used as
      biological markers of different inflammatory processes triggered by
      oxidative stress induced by a decrease in antioxidant defenses in the
      elderly population, with TNF-alpha as an indicator of chronic processes,
      such as aging, and IL-6 as a marker for acute responses, such as hypoxia.

TI  - Combined behavioral and individualized drug therapy versus individualized
      drug therapy alone for urge urinary incontinence in women.
PG  - 598-603
AB  - PURPOSE: We tested whether individualized drug therapy enhanced with
      behavioral training would result in better outcomes than individualized
      drug therapy alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were community
      dwelling women with urge predominant incontinence. Using a randomized
      clinical trial design women were randomized to 8 weeks (4 visits) of drug
      therapy alone (32) or drug therapy plus behavioral training (32). Drug
      therapy was individually titrated, extended release oxybutynin with
      proactive management of side effects. Behavioral training included pelvic
      floor muscle training and urge suppression techniques. The primary outcome
      measure was reduction in frequency of incontinence episodes on bladder
      diary at 8 weeks (with followup at 6 and 12 months). Secondary outcomes
      included patient satisfaction, global perception of improvement,
      Urogenital Distress Inventory and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire.
      RESULTS: In intent to treat analysis frequency of incontinence was reduced
      a mean of 88.5% in the drug alone group and 78.3% in the combined therapy
      group (p = 0.16). Outcomes were not significantly different between the
      groups in the analysis of completers (91.5% vs 86.2%, p = 0.34), or in
      either analysis at 6 or 12 months. The groups also did not differ
      significantly on secondary outcomes at any point. Participants in the drug
      alone group tended to be taking higher doses of oxybutynin at 8 weeks but
      the final dose did not differ significantly between the groups. Based on a
      conditional power calculation the trial was stopped early for futility.
      CONCLUSIONS: When drug therapy is implemented with frequent individualized
      dose titration, daily bladder diaries and careful management of side
      effects, initiating concurrent behavioral training does not enhance
      outcomes for urge incontinence in women.

TI  - Effect of whole-body vibration on bone properties in aging mice.
AB  - Recent studies suggest that whole-body vibration (WBV) can improve
      measures of bone health for certain clinical conditions and ages. In the
      elderly, there also is particular interest in assessing the ability of
      physical interventions such as WBV to improve coordination, strength, and
      movement speed, which help prevent falls and fractures and maintain
      ambulation for independent living. The current study evaluated the
      efficacy of WBV in an aging mouse model. Two levels of vibration - 0.5 and
      1.5g - were applied at 32Hz to CB57BL/6 male mice (n=9 each) beginning at
      age 18months and continuing for 12weeks, 30min/day, in a novel pivoting
      vibration device. Previous reports indicate that bone parameters in these
      mice begin to decrease substantially at 18months, equivalent to
      mid-fifties for humans. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and
      biomechanical assessments were made in the femur, radius, and lumbar
      vertebra to determine the effect of these WBV magnitudes and durations in
      the aging model. Sera also were collected for analysis of bone formation
      and breakdown markers. Mineralizing surface and cell counts were
      determined histologically. Bone volume in four regions of the femur did
      not change significantly, but there was a consistent shift toward higher
      mean density in the bone density spectrum (BDS), with the two vibration
      levels producing similar results. This new parameter represents an
      integral of the conventional density histogram. The amount of high density
      bone statistically improved in the head, neck, and diaphysis.
      Biomechanically, there was a trend toward greater stiffness in the 1.5g
      group (p=0.139 vs. controls in the radius), and no change in strength. In
      the lumbar spine, no differences were seen due to vibration. Both
      vibration groups significantly reduced pyridinoline crosslinks, a collagen
      breakdown marker. They also significantly increased dynamic
      mineralization, MS/BS. Furthermore, osteoclasts were most numerous in the
      1.5g group (p&lt;/=0.05). These findings suggest that some benefits of WBV
      found in previous studies of young and mature rodent models may extend to
      an aging population. Density parameters indicated 0.5g was more effective
      than 1.5g. Serological markers, by contrast, favored 1.5g, while
      biomechanically and histologically the results were mixed. Although the
      purported anabolic effect of WBV on bone homeostasis may depend on
      location and the parameter of interest, this emerging therapy at a minimum
      does not appear to compromise bone health by the measures studied here.

TI  - Loss of manganese superoxide dismutase leads to abnormal growth and signal
      transduction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
AB  - Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the mitochondria plays an
      important role in cellular defense against oxidative damage. Homozygous
      MnSOD knockout (Sod2(-/-)) mice are neonatal lethal, indicating the
      essential role of MnSOD in early development. To investigate the potential
      cellular abnormalities underlying the aborted development of Sod2(-/-)
      mice, we examined the growth of isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts
      (MEFs) from Sod2(-/-) mice. We found that the proliferation of Sod2(-/-)
      MEFs was significantly decreased compared with wild-type MEFs despite the
      absence of morphological differences. The Sod2(-/-) MEFs produced less
      cellular ATP, had lower O(2) consumption, generated more superoxide, and
      expressed less Prdx3 protein. Furthermore, the loss of MnSOD dramatically
      altered several markers involved in cell proliferation and growth,
      including decreased growth stimulatory function of mTOR signaling and
      enhanced growth inhibitory function of GSK-3beta signaling. Interestingly,
      the G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) signal
      transduction was also severely suppressed in Sod2(-/-) MEFs. Finally, the
      ratio of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II/LC3-I, an
      index of autophagic activity, was increased in Sod2(-/-) MEFs, consistent
      with a reduction in mTOR signal transduction. These data demonstrate that
      MnSOD deficiency results in alterations in several key signaling pathways,
      which may contribute to the lethal phenotype of Sod2(-/-) mice.

TI  - Cumulative lead exposure and age-related hearing loss: The VA normative
      aging study.
AB  - Although lead has been associated with hearing loss in occupational
      settings and in children, little epidemiologic research has been conducted
      on the impact of cumulative lead exposure on age-related hearing loss in
      the general population. We determined whether bone lead levels, a marker
      of cumulative lead exposure, are associated with decreased hearing ability
      in 448 men from the Normative Aging Study, seen between 1962 and 1996
      (2264 total observations). Air conduction hearing thresholds were measured
      at 0.25-8 kHz and pure-tone averages (PTA) (mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz)
      were computed. Tibia and patella lead levels were measured using K X-ray
      fluorescence between 1991 and 1996. In cross-sectional analyses, after
      adjusting for potential confounders including occupational noise, patella
      lead levels were significantly associated with poorer hearing thresholds
      at 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz and PTA. The odds of hearing loss significantly
      increased with patella lead levels. We also found significant positive
      associations between tibia lead and the rate change in hearing thresholds
      at 1, 2, and 8 kHz and PTA in longitudinal analyses. Our results suggest
      that chronic low-level lead exposure may be an important risk factor for
      age-related hearing loss and reduction of lead exposure could help prevent
      or delay development of age-related hearing loss.

TI  - Viscero-visceral hyperalgesia: Characterization in different clinical
      models.
AB  - Co-existing algogenic conditions in two internal organs in the same
      patient may mutually enhance pain symptoms (viscero-visceral
      hyperalgesia). The present study assessed this phenomenon in different
      models of visceral interaction. In a prospective evaluation, patients
      with: (a) coronary artery disease (CAD)+gallstone (Gs) (common sensory
      projection: T5); (b) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)+dysmenorrhea (Dys)
      (T10-L1); (c) dysmenorrhea/endometriosis+urinary calculosis (Cal)(T10-L1);
      and (d) gallstone+left urinary calculosis (Gs+LCal) (unknown common
      projection) were compared with patients with CAD, Gs, IBS, Dys or Cal
      only, for spontaneous symptoms (number/intensity of pain episodes) over
      comparable time periods and for referred symptoms (muscle hyperalgesia;
      pressure/electrical pain thresholds) from each visceral location. In
      patients' subgroups, symptoms were also re-assessed after treatment of
      each condition or after no treatment. (a) CAD+Gs presented more
      numerous/intense angina/biliary episodes and more referred muscle
      chest/abdominal hyperalgesia than CAD or Gs; cardiac revascularization or
      cholecystectomy also reduced biliary or cardiac symptoms, respectively
      (0.001&lt;p&lt;0.05). (b) IBS+Dys had more intestinal/menstrual pain and
      abdomino/pelvic muscle hyperalgesia than IBS or Dys; hormonal dysmenorrhea
      treatment also reduced IBS symptoms; IBS dietary treatment also improved
      dysmenorrhea (0.001&lt;p&lt;0.05) while no treatment of either conditions
      resulted in no improvement in time of symptoms from both. (c) Cal+Dys had
      more urinary/menstrual pain and referred lumbar/abdominal hyperalgesia
      than Cal or Dys; hormonal dysmenorrhea treatment/laser treatment for
      endometriosis also improved urinary symptoms; lithotripsy for urinary
      stone also reduced menstrual symptoms (0.001&lt;p&lt;0.05). (d) In Gs+LCal,
      cholecystectomy or urinary lithotripsy did not improve urinary or biliary
      symptoms, respectively. Mechanisms of viscero-visceral hyperalgesia
      between organs with documented partially common sensory projection
      probably involve sensitization of viscero-viscero-somatic convergent
      neurons.

TI  - Caloric restriction improves endothelial dysfunction during vascular
      aging: Effects on nitric oxide synthase isoforms and oxidative stress in
      rat aorta.
AB  - Aging is characterized by activation of inducible over endothelial nitric
      oxide synthase (iNOS and eNOS), impaired antioxidant activity and
      increased oxidative stress, which reduces nitric oxide bioavailability and
      causes endothelial dysfunction. Caloric restriction (CR) blunts oxidative
      stress. We investigated whether CR impacts endothelial dysfunction in
      aging and the underlying mechanisms. Aortas from young (YC, 6months of
      age) and old (OC, 24months of age) rats ad-libitum fed and from old rats
      caloric-restricted for 3-weeks (OR, 26%) were investigated.
      Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was impaired in OC, associated with
      reduced eNOS and increased iNOS expression (P&lt;0.05). Aortic nitrite was
      similar in OC and YC, but the contribution of calcium-independent NOS to
      total NOS activity was increased whereas that of calcium-dependent NOS was
      reduced (p&lt;/=0.0003). Plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
      (TBARS) were elevated in OC as well as aortic nitrotyrosine (P&lt;0.05).
      Expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and total SOD
      activity were impaired in OC (P&lt;0.05 vs. YC), whereas copper-zinc (CuZn)
      SOD expression was similar in OC and YC. CR restored endothelial
      dysfunction in old rats, reduced iNOS expression, total nitrite and
      calcium-independent NOS activity in aorta (P&lt;0.05) without changes in eNOS
      expression and calcium-dependent NOS activity. Sirtuin-1 expression did
      not differ among groups. Plasma TBARS and aortic nitrotyrosine were
      reduced (P&lt;0.05) in OR compared with OC. In OR CuZnSOD protein and SOD
      activity increased (P&lt;0.05) without changes in MnSOD expression.
      Short-term CR improves age-related endothelial dysfunction. Reversal of
      altered iNOS/eNOS ratio, reduced oxidative stress and increased SOD enzyme
      activity rather than enhanced NO production appear to be involved in this
      effect.

TI  - Kangen-karyu improves memory deficit caused by aging through normalization
      of neuro-plasticity-related signaling system and VEGF system in the brain.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Kangen-karyu (KK) is a traditional Chinese prescription
      consisting of six different herbs. This study was conducted to investigate
      the anti-dementia effect of KK on aging-induced cognitive deficits and the
      underlying mechanism using senescence-accelerated mice prone (SAMP8).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-week old SAMP8 (older SAMP8) were used as an
      animal model of aging and age-matched senescence-resistant inbred strain
      (SAMR1) and 8-week-old SAMP8 (young SAMP8) were as controls. Older SAMP8
      received daily administration of KK (100mg/kg, p.o.) or water vehicle for
      22 days. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, older SAMP8 exhibited
      cognitive deficits in the object recognition and object location tests;
      however, KK improved the deficits caused by aging. Moreover, the older
      SAMP8 treated with vehicle exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior in the
      elevated plus-maze test compared to SAMR1, but KK had no effect on
      emotional disorder of older SAMP8. The levels of biochemical factors
      related to neuro-plasticity and learning and memory; i.e., phosphorylated
      forms of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent
      protein kinase II, and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein, and
      brain-derived nootropic factor, were significantly decreased in older
      SAMP8 compared to those in the control animals. KK normalized the levels
      of these factors. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor type 2 in the cerebral
      cortices of older SAMP8 were down-regulated by aging, but these levels
      were reversed by KK. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that
      normalization of neuro-plasticity-related neuronal signaling and VEGF
      systems in the brain may be of the mechanisms underlying the ameliorative
      effects of KK on the cognitive deficits in older SAMP8.

TI  - Age effects on the asymmetry of the motor system: Evidence from cortical
      oscillatory activity.
AB  - Functional hemispheric asymmetry can be lost with aging. In this
      electroencephalographic study, we assessed hemispheric asymmetries in
      regulating motor responses by analyzing oscillatory brain activity during
      a go/nogo task in younger and older right-handed participants. Three
      conditions were embedded in the task: go, high-conflict and low-conflict
      nogo. The hand used to respond to go stimuli was varied block-wise.
      Independently of the go/nogo conditions and responding hand, young
      participants showed asymmetric desynchronizations in the mu (10Hz) and
      beta (18-22Hz) frequency bands that was stronger in the scalp sensorimotor
      region contralateral to the hand used for the go responses, while older
      adults showed a more symmetric pattern of desynchronization. These
      findings indicate that a loss of hemispheric asymmetry is a hallmark of
      the aging motor system, consistent with a decline of inter-hemispheric
      motor inhibition in normal aging.

TI  - Redox regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by glutathione.
AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) expressed
      in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was reversibly oxidized by hydrogen peroxide
      and reduced by cellular reductants. Reduction of hPTEN was delayed in each
      of S. cerevisiae gsh1Delta and gsh2Delta mutants. Expression of
      gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase Gsh1 in the gsh1Delta mutant rescued
      regeneration rate of hPTEN. Oxidized hPTEN was reduced by glutathione in a
      concentration- and time-dependent manner. Glutathionylated PTEN was
      detected. Incubation of 293T cells with BSO and knockdown expression of
      GCLc in HeLa cells by siRNA resulted in the delay of reduction of oxidized
      PTEN. Also, in HeLa cells transfected with GCLc siRNA, stimulation with
      epidermal growth factor resulted in the increase of oxidized PTEN and
      phosphorylation of Akt. These results suggest that the reduction of
      oxidized hPTEN is mediated by glutathione.

TI  - No dramatic age-related loss of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in
      Bcl-2 over-expression mice or Bax null mice.
PG  - 28
AB  - ABSTRACT: Age-related decline of neuronal function is associated with
      age-related structural changes. In the central nervous system, age-related
      decline of cognitive performance is thought to be caused by synaptic loss
      instead of neuronal loss. However, in the cochlea, age-related loss of
      hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) is consistently observed in
      a variety of species, including humans. Since age-related loss of these
      cells is a major contributing factor to presbycusis, it is important to
      study possible molecular mechanisms underlying this age-related cell
      death. Recent studies have suggested that apoptotic pathways are involved
      in age-related loss of hair cells and SGNs. In the present study, we
      examined the role of Bcl-2 gene in age-related hearing loss. In one
      transgenic mouse line over-expressing human Bcl-2, there were no
      significant differences between transgenic mice and wild type littermate
      controls in their hearing thresholds during aging. Histological analysis
      of the hair cells and SGNs showed no significant conservation of these
      cells in transgenic animals compared to the wild type controls during
      aging. These data suggest that Bcl-2 overexpression has no significant
      effect on age-related loss of hair cells and SGNs. We also found no delay
      of age-related hearing loss in mice lacking Bax gene. These findings
      suggest that age-related hearing loss is not through an apoptotic pathway
      involving key members of Bcl-2 family.

TI  - Preventive home visits to older home-dwelling people in Denmark: are
      invitational procedures of importance?
AB  - Abstract Since 1998 all municipalities in Denmark have been required by
      law to offer two annual preventive home visits to all home-dwelling
      citizens aged 75 or over. The influence of invitational procedures on
      acceptance rates has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to
      describe and investigate whether different invitational procedures were
      associated with first preventive home visit acceptance rates. The study
      was based on secondary analyses of data from the Danish Intervention Study
      on Preventive Home Visits. Data were collected from 1998 to 2002. Of the
      4060 participants in the main study, 3245 reported receiving an offer for
      an identifiable preventive home visit, of whom 2399 (73.9%) provided
      complete data for the main analyses in the present study. Invitational
      procedures were categorised as: (1) a letter with a proposed date and time
      for the visit, (2) a visitor telephone call, and (3) a letter with
      encouragement to phone the visitor for appointment (letter without a
      proposed date). Covariates included sex, age, experience with preventive
      interventions, functional ability, self rated health, social relations and
      psychosocial characteristics. Statistical analyses included chi-square
      tests, and bi- and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Different
      invitational procedures were associated with first preventive home visit
      acceptance rates. Significantly more men (75.1%) than women (62.8%)
      declined the first preventive home visit regardless of the invitational
      procedure. Compared to 'letter with a proposed date', men had an odds
      ratio of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.16-2.74) for declining visits when 'telephone
      call' was used and an odds ratio 2.81 (95% CI: 1.79-4.40) when 'letter
      without a proposed date' was used as the invitational procedure. In women
      the odds ratios were 1.23 (95% CI: 0.91-1.68) and 1.87 (95% CI:
      1.37-2.55), respectively.

TI  - Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic
      kidney disease: a hypothesis.
PG  - 317-23
AB  - Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of
      adults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases
      are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases
      may overlap with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of
      a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential
      problem is further compounded in elderly patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD), where the presence of an underlying hormonal problem such
      as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed to multiple comorbidities,
      the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is being recognized as a
      contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization and high
      mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
      frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers,
      anemia, low testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with
      thyroid hormonal abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and
      raise the question of whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid
      hormone changes in elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying
      reversible causes of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the
      associations between thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing
      factors of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause-effect
      relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to
      frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and treatment of
      thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
      importance.

      pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic treatment interventions.
PG  - 176-86
LID - 10.3928/19404921-20100526-01 [doi]
AB  - Geriatric (or late-life) depression is common in older adults, with an
      incidence that increases dramatically after age 70 to 85, as well as among
      those admitted to hospitals and those who reside in nursing homes. In this
      population, depression promotes disability and is associated with worsened
      outcomes of comorbid chronic medical diseases. Geriatric depression is
      often undetected or undertreated in primary care settings for various
      reasons, including the (incorrect) belief that depression is a normal part
      of aging. Current research suggests that while antidepressant agent use in
      older adults is improving in quality, room for improvement exists.
      Improving the pharmacotherapy of depression in older adults requires
      knowledge and understanding of many clinical factors. The purpose of this
      review is to discuss salient issues in geriatric depression, with a focus
      on pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic interventions.

TI  - Acute stress and chronic stress change brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase-coupled receptor (TrkB) expression in both
      young and aged rat hippocampus.
PG  - 661-71
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamic change of
      brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, protein, and tyrosine
      kinase-coupled receptor (TrkB) mRNA of the rat hippocampus under different
      stress conditions and to explore the influence of senescence on the
      productions expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By using forced-swimming in
      4 degrees C cold ice water and 25 degrees C warm water, young and aged
      male rats were randomly divided into acute stress (AS) and chronic mild
      repeated stress (CMRS) subgroups, respectively. BDNF productions and TrkB
      mRNA in the hippocampus were detected by using Western-blotting and
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), separately, at
      15, 30, 60, 180, and 720 min after the last stress session. RESULTS: The
      short AS induced a significant increase in BDNF mRNA and protein in both
      age groups, but the changes in the young group were substantially greater
      than those of the aged group (p &lt; 0.005). The CMRS resulted in a decrease
      in BDNF mRNA and protein, but a significant increase in TrkB mRNA in both
      young and age groups. The expression of BDNF mRNA and protein in the AS
      groups were higher than in the CMRS groups at 15, 30, and 60 min after
      stress. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the up/down-regulation of
      BDNF and TrkB were affected by aging and the stimulus paradigm, which

TI  - Psychosocial factors and metabolic parameters: Is there any association in
      elderly people? The Massa Lombarda Project.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Objective: Several studies claim that psychophysical stress and depression
      contribute significantly to cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. The
      aim of our research is to discover and analyse a possible relationship
      between two psychosocial disorders (depression and perceived mental
      stress) and traditional cardiovascular risk markers. Methods: We selected
      106 subjects (58 males and 48 females), mean age 79.5 +/- 3.8-years old,
      from the Massa Lombarda Project, an epidemiological study, including 7000
      north Italian adult subjects. We carried out anamnesis, clinical and blood
      tests. Then, we administered the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ range
      score 0-1) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SRDS range score 50-70
      Z), as validated instruments for depression and stress evaluation, which
      focus on the individual's subjective perception and emotional response.
      Statistical descriptive and inferential analyses of data collected were
      performed. Results: The multiple linear regression analysis showed a
      negative correlation between PSQ index score and uric acid, low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), body mass index (BMI), systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure values, a positive and statistically significant
      correlation between PSQ index score and triglycerides (p &lt; 0.05). We found
      an inverse relationship between Zung SRDS score and LDL-c, uric acid,
      glucose waist circumference values, this correlation was significant only
      for uric acid (p &lt; 0.01). Besides, a positive and significant correlation
      between Zung SRDS and triglycerides (p &lt; 0.05) was observed. Conclusion:
      We suppose that psycho-emotional stress and depression disorder, often
      diagnosed in elderly people, may influence different metabolic parameters
      (triglycerides, uric acid and BMI) that are involved in the complex
      process of metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Daily spiritual experiences in a biracial, community-based population of
      older adults.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe the levels of
      daily spiritual experiences (DSEs) in community-dwelling older adults, to
      compare the levels of spiritual experiences with the levels of prayer and
      religious service attendance, and to examine the demographic and
      psychosocial correlates of spiritual experiences. The data came from 6534
      participants in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, an ongoing
      population-based, biracial (65% African American) study of the risk
      factors for incident Alzheimer's disease among older adults. A 5-item
      version of the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale (DSES) was used in the
      study. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the
      relationship between sociodemographic and psychosocial factors and DSES
      scores. Results: The majority of the participants reported having
      spiritual experiences at least daily. In the bivariate analyses, African
      Americans and women had higher DSES scores than Whites and men,
      respectively (p's &lt; 0.001). Prayer and worship were moderately associated
      with DSES scores. In the multivariable analyses, African American race,
      older age, female gender, better self-rated health, and greater social
      networks were associated with higher DSES scores, while higher levels of
      education and depressive symptoms were associated with lower DSES scores.
      Conclusion: We observed high levels of spiritual experiences and found
      that the DSES is related to, but distinct from the traditional measures of
      religiosity. We found associations between DSES, demographic, and
      psychosocial factors that are consistent with the findings for other
      religiosity and spirituality (R/S) measures. Future research should test
      whether DSES contributes to our understanding of the relationship between
      R/S and health in older adults.

TI  - Sex- and age-specific differences in core body temperature of C57Bl/6
      mice.
AB  - Gender-specific differences in longevity are reported across species and
      are mediated by mechanisms not entirely understood. In C57Bl/6 mice,
      commonly used in aging research, males typically outlive females. Since in
      these animals modest but prolonged reduction of core body (Tc) increased
      life span, we hypothesized that differential Tc may contribute to
      sex-specific longevity. Here, we compared the circadian profiles of Tc and
      locomotor activity (LMA) of male and female C57Bl/6 mice. Since Tc and LMA
      normally change with age, measurements were carried out in young (3
      months) as well as in old (24 months) mice. In young females, Tc was
      influenced by estrous but was overall higher than in males. This
      difference was larger in old animals after age eliminated the variations
      associated with estrous. Although temperature homeostasis is regulated
      centrally by the sexually dimorphic hypothalamic preoptic area, these
      differences were uniquely dependent on the gonads. In fact, bilateral
      gonadectomy abolished the effects of estrous and increased resting Tc in
      males eliminating all sex-specific differences in Tc and LMA. These
      effects were only partially mimicked by hormonal replacement as Tc was
      affected by progesterone and to a lesser extent by estrogen but not by
      testosterone. Thus, gonadal-dependent modulation of Tc may be one of the
      physiological parameters contributing to gender-specific differences in
      longevity.

TI  - Obesity and aging: determinants of endothelial cell dysfunction and
      atherosclerosis.
AB  - Endothelial cells are both the source and target of factors contributing
      to atherosclerosis. After the discovery of the endothelium-derived
      relaxing factor (EDRF) by Robert F. Furchgott in 1980 it soon became clear
      that endothelial cells also release vasoactive factors distinct from
      nitric oxide (NO) namely, endothelium-derived contracting factors (EDCF)
      as well as hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF). Vasoactive factors derived from
      endothelial cells include NO/EDRF, reactive oxygen species, endothelins
      and angiotensins which have either EDRF or EDCF functions,
      cyclooxygenase-derived EDCFs and EDRFs, and EDHFs. Endothelial factors are
      formed by enzymes such as NO synthase, cyclooxygenase, converting enyzmes,
      NADPH oxidases, and epoxigenases, among others, and participate in the
      regulation of vascular homeostasis under physiological conditions;
      however, their abnormal regulation due to endothelial cell dysfunction
      contributes to disease processes such as atherosclerosis, arterial
      hypertension, and renal disease. Because of recent changes in world
      demographics and the declining health status of the world's population,
      both aging and obesity as independent risk factors for
      atherosclerosis-related diseases such as coronary artery disease and
      stroke, will continue to increase in the years to come. Obesity and
      associated conditions such as arterial hypertension and diabetes are now
      also some of the primary health concerns among children and adolescents.
      The similarities of pathomechanisms activated in obesity and aging suggest
      that obesity-at least in the vasculature-can be considered to have effects
      consistent with accelerated, "premature" aging. Pathomechanisms as well as
      the clinical issues of obesity- and aging-associated vascular changes
      important for atherosclerosis development and prevention are discussed.

TI  - Subclinical Hypothyroidism in the Elderly: To Treat or Not to Treat?
AB  - Aging is associated with a host of alterations in thyroid gland structure
      and function. Some of these changes have favorable effects on longevity,
      whereas others are maladaptive and contribute to a decline in health and
      quality of life. An area of particular controversy is the diagnosis and
      management of subclinical hypothyroidism in the elderly. The clinical
      diagnosis of hypothyroidism in the elderly is difficult, because many
      signs and symptoms associated with hypothyroidism are commonly present in
      euthyroid elderly individuals. The biochemical profile of subclinical
      hypothyroidism includes normal serum levels of thyroid hormones with
      mildly elevated serum thyrotropin concentrations in the range of 4.5 to 10
      mIU/L. In this article, the epidemiology of subclinical hypothyroidism in
      the elderly is reviewed, the potential advantages of mild hypothyroidism
      in people over the age of 75 years are discussed, and some guidelines for
      screening and management of this common thyroid dysfunction are suggested.

TI  - Association of periodontitis and metabolic syndrome in the Baltimore
      Longitudinal Study of Aging.
PG  - 238-42
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises central obesity,
      insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidemia, interrelated metabolic
      risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A state of low-grade
      systemic inflammation may underlie this constellation of risk factors.
      Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as periodontal disease, may
      contribute to systemic inflammation and development of MetS. This study
      examines the association of periodontitis with MetS with and without
      consideration of systemic inflammatory status. METHODS: The association of
      alveolar bone loss (none/slight vs moderate/severe) determined from
      panoramic radiographs and MetS parameters were analyzed using logistic
      regression, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking in 112 men and
      78 women (mean+/-SD age 56.7+/-13.3 and 60.0+/-12.1, respectively)
      participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. RESULTS:
      Participants with radiographic evidence of moderate to advanced alveolar
      bone loss were significantly more likely to have MetS than those with
      minimal or no bone loss (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.1-6.1, p&lt;0.05). No significant
      differences in systemic inflammation were found between periodontal
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: The association of alveolar bone loss to MetS is
      consistent with the hypothesis that destructive periodontal disease may
      contribute to the development of MetS and elevations in systemic
      inflammation. Longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify the role of
      periodontal disease in the development of MetS and conditions associated
      with chronic inflammation.

TI  - Low acceptance of treatment in the elderly for the secondary prevention of
      osteoporotic fracture in the acute rehabilitation setting.
PG  - 231-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Given the high risk of subsequent fracture among
      elderly persons with fracture, it is important to initiate secondary
      treatment for osteoporosis. Acute rehabilitation centers may offer a
      unique opportunity to introduce treatment. Therefore, we evaluated
      willingness-to-participate and compliance with evidence-based
      interventions for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fracture in a
      non-randomized study conducted in the acute rehabilitation setting. We
      also described differences in baseline characteristics between study
      participants and non-participants. METHODS: All consecutive, community
      dwelling admissions to an acute rehabilitation unit (Boston, MA) with the
      diagnosis of fracture were screened for enrollment. Eligible subjects were
      offered a free, 6-month supply of alendronate/cholecalciferol (70 mg/2800
      IU weekly), calcium and vitamin D supplements, and fall prevention
      strategies. Six-month compliance (&gt; or =75% consumption of medication or
      supplement) with the interventions was determined at a home visit.
      RESULTS: Among 62 eligible subjects, 25 agreed to participate.
      Non-participants were older than participants (86 vs 80 yrs, p&lt;0.01).
      There was no significant difference between other characteristics of
      participants and non-participants including sex, weight, type of fracture,
      cognitive status, and functional status. The most common reason for
      non-participation was reluctance to take another medication. Among
      participants, only 52% were compliant with alendronate and 58% were
      compliant with calcium and vitamin D supplementation at 6 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Willingness- to-participate and compliance with secondary
      prevention strategies for osteoporosis was low in the acute rehabilitation
      setting, even when medications were provided free of cost. Educating
      individuals with fracture and their families on the consequences and
      treatment of osteoporosis may help to decrease the risk of sustaining a
      second fracture by accepting secondary preventive measures.

TI  - Endothelin-1 is Elevated in Alzheimer's Disease Brain Microvessels and is
      Neuroprotective.
AB  - The vasoactive protein endothelin-1 (ET-1) is produced by vascular
      endothelial cells and participates in the regulation of vascular
      inflammation. We have previously documented that the cerebral
      microvasculature is a source of inflammatory proteins and a likely
      contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this
      study, we (a) compare expression of ET-1 in brain microvessels isolated
      from AD and control brains; (b) determine thrombin regulation of ET-1
      synthesis and release in brain endothelial cells; and (c) assess the
      effects of ET-1 on neuronal viability in vitro. Western blot analysis
      indicates a significantly higher level of ET-1 in AD vessels compared to
      vessels from age-matched controls. ET-1 expression and secretion are both
      induced by the inflammatory and neurotoxic protein thrombin. Pretreatment
      of neuronal cultures with ET-1 significantly increases neuronal survival
      when cells are challenged with oxidative stress (H2O2) or thrombin. The
      protective effect of ET-1 is blocked by incubation with an inhibitor of
      the c-Jun kinase (JNK) cascade. These data demonstrate that in the brain
      microvasculature dysfunctional or stressed endothelial cells express ET-1
      and that this protein promotes the survival of brain neurons exposed to
      injury.

TI  - Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Reduced Odds of MCI: The Mayo Clinic Study
      of Aging.
AB  - Mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, PUFA) have been associated
      with a reduced risk of dementia. The association of these fatty acids with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is not fully established. The objective of
      the study was to investigate the cross-sectional association of dietary
      fatty acids with MCI in a population-based sample. Participants aged 70
      years on October 1, 2004, were evaluated using the Clinical Dementia
      Rating Scale (participant and informant), a neurological evaluation, and
      neuropsychological testing. A panel of nurses, physicians, and
      neuropsychologists reviewed the data for each participant in order to
      establish a diagnosis of MCI, normal cognition, or dementia by consensus.
      Participants also completed a 128-item food-frequency questionnaire. Among
      1,233 non-demented subjects, 163 (13.2%) had MCI. The odds ratio (OR) of
      MCI decreased with increasing PUFA and MUFA intake. Compared to the lowest
      tertile, the OR (95% confidence interval) for the upper tertiles were 0.44
      (0.29-0.66; p for trend = 0.0004) for total PUFA; 0.44 (0.30-0.67; p for
      trend = 0.0004) for omega-6 fatty acids; 0.62 (0.42-0.91; p for trend =

TI  - Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Cognitive Decline, and Alzheimer's Disease: A
      Critical Review and Evaluation of the Literature.
AB  - The precipitous decline of memory and independence associated with
      cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease is emotionally and
      financially devastating to patients, their families, and caretakers.
      Studies from animal models and cell cultures have shown that omega-3 fatty
      acids (n-3 FAs) are neuroprotective during development and aging. Numerous
      epidemiologic, postmortem, and clinical trials have been published on fish
      or n-3 FAs and Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or cognitive decline. Yet
      results across the literature in humans are inconsistent and thus
      difficult to interpret. This review provides background and context needed
      for interpretation of the findings, summaries of the literature grouped by
      longitudinal studies of fish, dietary n-3 FAs, blood levels of fatty
      acids, postmortem studies, and clinical trials, and subsequent
      interpretation of findings. Possible reasons for discrepancies in the
      literature are presented throughout, and conclusions suggest directions
      for future research.

TI  - Reduction in Post-Synaptic Scaffolding PSD-95 and SAP-102 Protein Levels
      in the Alzheimer Inferior Temporal Cortex is Correlated with Disease
      Pathology.
AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-evoked excitotoxicity contributes to
      region-specific loss of glutamatergic synapses responsible for cognitive
      decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, the post-synaptic scaffold
      proteins PSD-95 and SAP-102, which regulate NMDA receptor synaptic
      activity and expression, were investigated in human AD autopsy brain
      tissue. Using absolute quantification real-time PCR, we detected reduced
      expression of synaptophysin in both the pathologically susceptible
      inferior temporal cortex and hippocampus, consistent with previous
      reports. PSD-95 and SAP-102 mRNA was reduced, albeit not significantly.
      Proteins were precisely quantified against recombinant truncated protein
      standards. No differences were observed for proteins in AD spared
      occipital cortex between AD cases and controls. PSD-95 and SAP-102 protein
      expression was markedly reduced in the AD inferior temporal cortex. Both
      mRNA and protein levels were reduced according to disease severity. SAP102
      protein levels were significantly reduced in AD subjects carrying a copy
      of the APOEepsilon4 allele. This is the first study to investigate SAP-102
      in the aging human brain and suggest a possible mechanism for NMDA
      receptor expression aberrations in AD.

TI  - miRNAs regulate SIRT1 expression during mouse embryonic stem cell
      differentiation and in adult mouse tissues.
AB  - SIRT1 is increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of stress
      responses, replicative senescence, inflammation, metabolism, and aging.
      SIRT1 expression is regulated transcriptionally and
      post-transcriptionally, and its enzymatic activity is controlled by NAD+
      levels and interacting proteins. We found that SIRT1 protein levels were
      much higher in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) than in differentiated
      tissues. miRNAs post-transcriptionally downregulated SIRT1 during mESC
      differentiation and maintained low levels of SIRT1 expression in
      differentiated tissues. Specifically, miR-181a and b, miR-9, miR-204,
      miR-199b, and miR-135a suppressed SIRT1 protein expression. Inhibition of
      mir-9, the SIRT1-targeting miRNA induced earliest during mESC
      differentiation, prevented SIRT1 downregulation. Conversely, SIRT1 protein
      levels were upregulated post-transcriptionally during the reprogramming of
      mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
      cells. The regulation of SIRT1 protein levels by miRNAs might provide new
      opportunities for therapeutic tissue-specific modulation of SIRT1
      expression and for reprogramming of somatic cells into iPS cells.

TI  - LIM-domain proteins TRIP6 and LPP associate with shelterin to mediate
      telomere protection.
AB  - POT1 is the single stranded telomeric overhang binding protein, and is
      part of the shelterin complex, a group of six proteins essential for
      proper telomere function. The reduction or abrogation of POT1 DNA binding
      activity in mammalian cells results in telomere elongation, or activation
      of the ATR DNA damage response at telomeres. Therefore, overhang binding
      represents the functionally relevant activity of POT1. To better
      understand the roles of POT1, we sought to isolate proteins that interact
      with the DNA binding domain of the protein. A yeast two-hybrid screen was
      implemented using a C-terminal truncation termed POT1DeltaC, retaining the
      DNA binding domain. This screen yielded a partial cDNA corresponding to
      TRIP6, a member of the LIM domain protein family. TRIP6 could
      co-immunoprecipitate with POT1, TRF2 and TIN2 in human cells, arguing for
      association with the whole shelterin complex, and was detected at
      telomeres by ChIP. TRIP6 depletion by siRNA led to the induction of
      telomere dysfunction induced foci (TIFs), indicating a role in telomere
      protection. A closely related LIM domain protein, LPP, was also found at
      telomeres and was also important for repressing the DNA damage response.
      We propose that TRIP6 and LPP are both required for telomere protection.

TI  - Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Stiffness As a Mechanism for Increased Aortic
      Stiffness With Aging.
AB  - Rationale: Increased aortic stiffness, an important feature of many
      vascular diseases, eg, aging, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and aortic
      aneurysms, is assumed because of changes in extracellular matrix (ECM).
      Objective: We tested the hypothesis that the mechanisms also involve
      intrinsic stiffening of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Methods and
      Results: Stiffness was measured in vitro both by atomic force microscopy
      (AFM) and in a reconstituted tissue model, using VSMCs from aorta of young
      versus old male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) (n=7/group), where aortic
      stiffness increases by 200% in vivo. The apparent elastic modulus was
      increased (P&lt;0.05) in old (41.7+/-0.5 kPa) versus young (12.8+/-0.3 kPa)
      VSMCs but not after disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton with
      cytochalasin D. Stiffness of the VSMCs in the reconstituted tissue model
      was also higher (P&lt;0.05) in old (23.3+/-3.0 kPa) than in young (13.7+/-2.4
      kPa). Conclusions: These data support the novel concept, not appreciated
      previously, that increased vascular stiffness with aging is attributable
      not only to changes in ECM but also to intrinsic changes in VSMCs.

TI  - Measurement of Gray and White Matter Atrophy in Dementia with Lewy Bodies
      Using Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie
      Algebra: A Comparison with Conventional Voxel-Based Morphometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DLB is recognized as the second major form of
      dementia in the elderly. The regional pattern of GM atrophy in DLB highly
      overlaps that in AD. The aim of this study was to identify the critical
      pattern of atrophy in DLB by using DARTEL, which provides improved
      registration accuracy compared with that of conventional VBM. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: We evaluated 51 patients with probable AD, 43 patients with
      probable DLB, and 40 age-matched healthy controls. The pattern of GM
      atrophy in each group was compared by using conventional VBM and
      VBM-DARTEL. RESULTS: Regional patterns of atrophy identified by using
      conventional VBM differed significantly from those identified by using
      VBM-DARTEL. A decrease in GM volume in the MTLs in both AD and DLB was
      identified with VBM-DARTEL; the decrease was greater in patients with AD
      than in those with DLB. Comparisons with healthy controls revealed that
      the WM volume of the whole brain was preserved in patients with DLB. In
      contrast, a severe bilateral decrease in WM in the MTLs was detected in
      patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: VBM-DARTEL provided more accurate results,
      and it enabled the identification of more localized morphologic
      alterations than did conventional VBM. Analysis of WM preservation in DLB
      could help to differentiate this condition from AD.

TI  - Accelerated Spirometric Decline In Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficient New York
      City Firefighters.
AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND: On 9/11/2001 the World Trade Center (WTC) collapse
      caused massive air pollution, producing variable amounts of lung function
      reduction in the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) rescue workforce.
      Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a risk factor for obstructive
      airway disease. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal cohort study
      investigated influence of AAT deficiency on adjusted longitudinal
      spirometric change (forced expiratory volume during the first second
      [FEV1]) in 90 WTC-exposed FDNY rescue workers over the first 4 years
      post-9/11/2001. Workers with protease inhibitor (Pi) Z heterozygosity were
      considered moderately AAT-deficient; PiS homozygosity or PiS
      heterozygosity without concomitant PiZ heterozygosity was mildly
      deficient, and PiM homozygosity was normal. Alternately, workers had low
      AAT levels if serum AAT was &lt;/= 20 mumol/l. RESULTS: In addition to normal
      aging-related decline (37 ml/year), significant FEV1 decline accelerations
      developed with increasing AAT deficiency severity (110 ml/year and 32
      ml/year for moderate and mild deficiency) or with low AAT serum levels (49
      ml/year). Spirometric rates pre-9/11/2001 did not show accelerations with
      AAT deficiency. Among workers with low AAT levels, cough persisted in a
      significant number of individuals to 4 years post-9/11/2001. CONCLUSIONS:
      AAT-deficient FDNY rescue workers had significant spirometric decline
      accelerations and persistent airway symptoms during the first 4 years
      after the WTC exposure. This represents a novel gene-by-environment
      interaction. Clinically meaningful decline acceleration occurred even with
      the mild serum AAT level reductions associated with PiS heterozygosity
      (without concomitant PiZ heterozygosity).

TI  - A new approach utilizing real-time qPCR to detect in vitro base excision
      repair.
AB  - DNA lesions in mammalian cells may be induced by reactive oxygen species,
      alkylation, and ionizing radiation. This damage can then be repaired via
      the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which includes single strand break
      repair (SSBR). Thus, the BER (SSBR) pathway plays a critical role in
      maintaining genomic integrity, and may help us to better understand the
      mechanisms of aging, tumor formation, and degenerative diseases. AP site
      (apurinic/apyrimidinic site) or damaged base excision, nucleotide
      insertion and ligation are included in the BER (SSBR) pathway, which are
      facilitated by different enzymes at each step. Most previous in vitro BER
      studies have used modified radiolabeled (32)P oligonucleotide substrates.
      Which is a very conventional method for in vitro BER assay. However, the
      use of radioactive isotope material was limited in various laboratories
      which are unable to handle radioactive hazard. In this study, we developed
      a novel technique using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify BER
      activity in in vitro assays. Single strand breaks, DNA ligase activity,
      and glycosylase activity were detected to establish the feasibility and
      advantages of this qPCR technique for in vitro BER profiling.

TI  - Age-Related Changes in White Matter Lesions, Hippocampal Atrophy, and
      Cerebral Microbleeds in Healthy Subjects Without Major Cerebrovascular
      Risk Factors.
AB  - Although cumulative evidence indicates that risk factors for
      arteriosclerosis have an impact on age-related changes in brain pathology,
      the influence of aging without major risk factors on changes in brain
      structures has not yet been fully elucidated. We used magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) to study how aging affects structural changes in the brain
      (eg, white matter lesions, hippocampal atrophy [HA], microbleeds) in
      normal subjects without major risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases.
      We studied 1108 subjects who underwent voluntary brain screening and had
      no cerebrovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
      or hyperlipidemia. We examined the conventional and T2-weighted MRI to
      define white matter hyperintensities, HA, and cerebral microbleeds in
      addition to all physical parameters, blood biochemical data, and
      neuropsychiatric symptoms. We found that the prevalence of white matter
      lesions and HA increased significantly with age (P &lt; .001). Logistic
      analysis showed that periventricular hyperintensity was significantly
      related to age (P &lt; .0001) and depressive state (P &lt; .01). A linear
      relation was found between white matter lesions and HA (P &lt; .05). Cerebral
      microbleeds also increased with age, and their presence was associated
      with HA (P &lt; .001). White matter lesions, HA, and cortical microbleeds
      were associated with one another in healthy elderly subjects, and these
      changes were affected by the aging process independent of any
      cerebrovascular risk factors. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy may underlie
      these age-related brain changes.

TI  - Spread of Odontogenic Infections in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
AB  - PURPOSE: Odontogenic infections constitute a substantial portion of
      diseases encountered by oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Infections start
      from dental tissues and sometimes rapidly spread to contiguous spaces. The
      consequence is a fulminant disease with significant morbidity and
      mortality. The study was aimed at studying the pattern of spread, approach
      to management, and outcome of these infections at a Nigerian teaching
      hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all patients with
      orofacial infections who presented to our center over an 18-month period
      was carried out. The medical records were reviewed to retrieve the
      following: age, gender, source of infection, anatomic fascial spaces
      involved, associated medical conditions, various treatment modalities,
      types of antibiotics administered, causative micro-organisms, length of
      stay in the hospital, and any complications encountered. Infections were
      classified into 2 categories: those that are confined to the dentoalveolar
      tissues belong to category I, and those that have spread into the
      local/regional soft tissue spaces and beyond belong to category II.
      RESULTS: Odontogenic infections constituted 11.3% of the total oral and
      maxillofacial surgery cases. A total of 261 patients were treated for
      odontogenic infections. There were 146 female patients (59.8%) and 98 male
      patients (40.2%) in the first category, whereas the second category
      comprised 10 male patients (58.8%) and 7 female patients (41.2%). The
      fascial spaces involved, in descending order, were submasseteric in 10
      (22.7%), submandibular in 9 (20.5%), and sublingual in 6 (13.6%). The
      causative micro-organisms commonly found were Klebsiella and Streptococcus
      spp. Incision and drainage were performed in the 17 cases with spreading
      infection. Amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and metronidazole were
      the most routinely administered antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience
      shows that delay in presentation, self-medication, aging, male gender, and
      unusual causative agents are some of the factors associated with spread.
      Therefore efforts must be made to further improve public dental awareness.

TI  - "I like to be an informed person but..." negotiating responsibility for
      treatment decisions in cancer care.
AB  - Social expectations surrounding sickness have undergone a transformation
      in Western welfare states. Emerging discourses about patients' roles and
      responsibilities do not however always map neatly onto patients' actions,
      experiences or desires. This paper emerges from a study in Ontario,
      Canada. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 5 women diagnosed with breast
      cancer we explore the activity and effort prompted for patients by the
      routine professional practice of outlining treatment options and
      encouraging patients to choose between them. We highlight research
      participants' complex responses to their responsibility for treatment
      decisions: their accepting, deflecting and reframing and their active
      negotiation of responsibility with professionals. The literature on
      treatment decision making typically characterizes people who resist taking
      an active role as overwhelmed, misinformed about the nature of treatment
      decisions, or more generally lacking capacity to participate. In this
      paper we suggest that patients' expressions of ambivalence about making
      treatment choices can be understood otherwise: as efforts to recast the
      identities and positions they and their physicians are assigned in the
      organization of cancer care. We also begin to map key features of this
      organization, particularly discourses of patient empowerment, and
      evidence-based medicine.

TI  - Bioinformatic processing to identify single nucleotide polymorphism that
      potentially affect Ape1 function.
AB  - Inactivation of DNA damage response mechanisms is associated with several
      disease syndromes, including cancer, aging and neurodegeneration. A major
      corrective pathway for alkylation or oxidative DNA damage is base excision
      repair (BER). As part of an effort to identify variation in DNA repair
      genes, we used the expressed sequence tag (EST) database to identify amino
      acid variation in Ape1, an essential gene in the BER repair pathway.
      Nucleotide substitutions were considered valid only if the amino acid
      changes were observed in at least two independent EST sequencing runs
      (i.e. two independent EST reports). In total eighty amino acid variants
      were identified for the Ape1 gene. Using software tools SIFT and PolyPhen,
      which predict impacts of amino acid substitutions on protein structure and
      function, twenty-six variants were predicted by both algorithms to be
      deleterious to protein function. Majority of these intolerant mutations
      such as V206C and F240S, lie within the core of the protein and may affect
      the stability and folding of Ape1, or in the case of N212H, N212K, and
      Y171N, are close to the enzyme's active site and could drastically affect
      its function. A few of the intolerant mutations, i.e., G178V and E217R,
      are surface residues and are far from the active site, and as such, the
      predicted effect on Ape1 stability or function is not evident. These
      variants are reagents for further protein function studies and molecular
      epidemiology studies of cancer susceptibility.

TI  - Peroxin 5: A cycling receptor for protein translocation into peroxisomes.
AB  - Peroxins are proteins that regulate the biogenesis of peroxisomes-small
      vesicular subcellular organelles essential for human life and health. A
      key peroxin - to date the best studied - is peroxin 5. Structurally,
      peroxin 5 is a bi-domain protein of about 70kDa containing both globular
      and non-globular segments and displaying conformational flexibility.
      Functionally, it is a cycling receptor for importing essential enzymes
      into the peroxisome lumen, facilitated by highly promiscuous interactions
      with numerous proteins and possibly lipids. Peroxin 5 has medical
      significance in that (i) congenital defects can lead to fatal peroxisome
      biogenesis disorders, (ii) inefficient peroxisome targeting is linked to
      disease and aging and (iii) differences between human peroxin 5 and
      homologues in pathogens may be exploited in the development of
      therapeutics.

TI  - SIRT1 variants are associated with aging in a healthy Han Chinese
      population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aging is influenced by diverse environmental and genetic risk
      factors. The SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1) gene has been shown to
      regulate lifespan and aging in previous studies. We determined whether
      variation in the SIRT1 gene is associated with aging in healthy Chinese
      population. METHODS: The study population comprised 482 healthy, unrelated
      Chinese subjects, of which 246 were aging individuals from 60 to 91years
      old, and 236 younger individuals from 35 and 59years old. All subjects
      were from Shenyang, China. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were
      analyzed: rs3758391 near the 5' end of the SIRT1 gene; and rs4746720, in
      the 3' untranslated region. RESULTS: Differences in allele and genotype
      frequency were seen between the groups, with rs3758391/C more common than
      rs3758391/T in the aging subjects (odds ratio=1.453, p=0.026), and with
      rs3758391/CC more common than rs3758391/CT and rs3758391/TT in the aging
      subjects (odds ratio=3.042, p=0.027). For the 3' SNP, rs4746720/C was more
      common than rs4746720/T in the aging subjects (odds ratio=1.347, p=0.022),
      and rs4746720/CC was more common than rs4746720/CT and rs4746720/CT in the
      aging subjects (odds ratio=1.461, p=0.049). The haplotype frequency
      distribution was also different, with haplotype CC more common in the
      older group (odds ratio=1.63, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest
      that SIRT1 gene polymorphisms may add a new factor on the multifactorial
      genetic contributions to aging.

TI  - Development and retention of fine psychomotor skills: implications for the
      aging dentist.
PG  - a25
AB  - Dentistry is a profession that involves the acquisition and maintenance of
      fine psychomotor skills. The many components of the motor system in the
      brain work together during all movements, but each area is activated to a
      varying degree depending on whether an individual is learning, training or
      maintaining expertise. The transition from nonexpert to expert involves
      practice and experience to allow imprinting of neuronal connections within
      the brain, which in turn causes those practised movements to become
      automated. With age, many people slowly lose memory, but are the fine
      motor movements that a dentist has mastered over a lifetime also lost? The
      aging expert experiences the same deterioration as an aging nonexpert in
      tasks that are unrelated to the expertise, but tasks that an expert has
      selectively maintained through decades of practice are retained through
      aging.

TI  - Nocturia.
PG  - 403-7
AB  - Nocturia is a common symptom in women which has profound negative impact
      on the quality of life. With the increase in aging population, nocturia is
      becoming an important clinical problem. A proper understanding of
      cardio-respiratory, metabolic, and neurological patho-physiology of
      nocturia is imperative for appropriate management of nocturia. When
      managing a patient with nocturia it is important to evaluate the patient
      as a whole rather than from urological perspective only. In this article
      we attempt to discuss the definition, etiology, clinical features and
      management of nocturia so that a comprehensive approach to management can
      be adopted when faced with a woman complaining of nocturia.

TI  - Ramelteon attenuates age-associated hypertension and weight gain in
      spontaneously hypertensive rats.
PG  - 114-20
AB  - The neuroendocrine theory of aging suggests the common mechanisms of
      developmental (prereproductive) and aging (postreproductive) processes and
      identified a cluster of conditions (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia,
      type 2 diabetes, menopause, late onset depression, vascular cognitive
      impairment, impairment of immune defense, and some forms of cancer) as
      age-associated neuroendocrine disorders (AAND). Obesity, dyslipidemia,
      hypertension, and type 2 diabetes were later described as metabolic
      syndrome (MetS). Because melatonin attenuated development of MetS is
      age-dependent, that is, in young and old, but not in middle-aged rats, we
      studied the effect of the selective melatonin agonist, Ramelteon, on the
      two core symptoms of MetS/AAND: hypertension and body weight gain in
      spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto male rats
      (WKY). SHR rats developed hypertension at the time of maximal weight gain
      that coincided with the onset of reproductive activity (8-10 weeks old).
      Chronic (but not acute) administration of Ramelteon (in drinking water, 8
      mg/kg/day, from 4 to 12 weeks of age) attenuated age-associated increase
      of systolic blood pressure (tail-cuff method) by 45%, and age-associated
      body weight gain by 30%. Acute and chronic Ramelteon did not affect blood
      pressure and body weight in normotensive WKY rats. Ramelteon-induced
      attenuation of age-associated hypertension and weight gain suggests that
      Ramelteon might attenuate the other symptoms of MetS/AAND and might be
      useful in the treatment of MetS/AAND during puberty, menopause, and old
      age.

TI  - Metabolic syndrome, age-associated neuroendocrine disorders, and
      dysregulation of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - The neuroendocrine theory of aging identified a cluster of conditions
      (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes type 2, menopause, late
      onset depression, vascular cognitive impairment, impairment of immune
      defense, and some forms of cancer, e.g., breast and prostate) as
      age-associated neuroendocrine disorders (AAND). Obesity, dyslipidemia,
      hypertension, and type 2 diabetes were later described as metabolic
      syndromes (MetS). Chronic inflammation is currently considered as a common
      feature of MetS/AAND. One of the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation
      might trigger and/or maintain the development of MetS/AAND is
      transcriptional induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO),
      rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan (TRY)-kynurenine (KYN) pathway, by
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC). Activation of IDO shifts TRY metabolism
      from serotonin synthesis to formation of "kynurenines." Diminished
      serotonin production is associated with mental depression while increased
      formation of kynurenines might contribute to development of MetS/AAND via
      their apoptotic, neurotoxic, and pro-oxidative effects, and upregulation
      of inducible nitric oxide synthase, phospholipase A2, arachidonic acid,
      prostaglandin, 5-lipoxygenase, and leukotriene cascade. The combined
      presence of high producers of alleles of polymorphic PIC genes (e.g.,
      interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha) might account for the
      genetic predisposition to high levels of PIC production, leading to
      "superinduction" of IDO. The other rate-limiting enzyme of the TRY-KYN
      pathway, TRY 2,3-dioxygenase, is activated by substrate (TRY) and
      cortisol. Therefore, KYN-TRY metabolism might be the meeting point for
      gene-environment interaction and a new target for prevention and treatment
      of MetS/AAND.

TI  - Nutraceuticals in diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
PG  - 216-26
AB  - Metabolic syndrome represents a clustering of risk factors related to an
      elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Occurrence of
      both metabolic syndrome and diabetes and their vascular complications
      share several pathogenetic features including subclinical, low-grade
      inflammation, altered oxidative/antioxidant status, and persistent
      platelet activation. Despite the availability of multiple interventions to
      counteract these metabolic changes, including appropriate diet, regular
      exercise, weight control and drugs, epidemiological data are witnessing
      the growing trend of the problem, reflecting both the multifactorial
      nature of these diseases as well as the scarce compliance of patients to
      established strategies. Several nutraceuticals used in clinical practice
      have been shown to target the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, metabolic
      syndrome and their complications and to favorably modulate a number of
      biochemical and clinical endpoints. These compounds include antioxidant
      vitamins, such as vitamins C and E, flavonoids, vitamin D, conjugated
      linoleic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, minerals such as chromium and
      magnesium, alpha-lipoic acid, phytoestrogens, and dietary fibers. Several
      areas of concern exist regarding the use of dietary supplements and
      nutraceuticals in this setting, including product standardization,
      definition of optimal dosing regimen, potential side effects, drug
      interactions, and need for evidence-based indications.

TI  - Topical retinoids in the management of photodamaged skin: From theory to
      evidence-based practical approach.
AB  - Abstract Skin, being exposed directly to the environment, represents a
      unique model for demonstrating the synergistic effects of intrinsic and
      extrinsic factors on the aging process. Ultraviolet radiation is the major
      factor among exogenous stressors responsible for premature skin aging. The
      problem of skin aging has captured public attention and has an important
      social impact. Different therapeutic approaches have been developed to
      treat cutaneous aging and to diminish or prevent the negative effects of
      ultraviolet radiation. Topical retinoids represent an important and
      powerful class of molecules in the dermatologist's hands for the treatment
      of photodamaged skin. Since their introduction more than 20 years ago,
      topical retinoids have shown beneficial efficacy and good safety profiles
      in the management of photodamaged skin, and as therapeutic anti-aging
      agents. This review provides a brief retrospect of the development of
      topical retinoids in the treatment of photodamaged skin, elucidates their
      mechanism of action, delineates their use and addresses clinical,
      pharmaceutical and regulatory issues in connection with their intended
      use.

TI  - Ghrelin Receptor Signaling: A Promising Therapeutic Target for Metabolic
      Syndrome and Cognitive Dysfunction.
AB  - The neuroendocrine hormone ghrelin is an octanoylated 28-residue peptide
      that exerts numerous physiological functions. Ghrelin exerts its effects
      on the body mainly through a highly conserved G protein-coupled receptor
      known as the growth hormone secretagagogue receptor subtype 1a (GHS-R1a).
      Ghrelin and GSH-R1a are widely expressed in both peripheral and central
      tissues/organs, and ghrelin signaling plays a critical role in maintaining
      energy balance and neuronal health. The multiple orexigenic effects of
      ghrelin and its receptor have been studied in great detail, and
      GHS-R1a-mediated ghrelin signaling has long been a promising target for
      the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as obesity. In addition to its
      well-characterized metabolic effects, there is also mounting evidence that
      ghrelin-mediated GHS-R1a signaling exerts neuroprotective effects on the
      brain. In this review, we will summarize some of the effects of
      ghrelin-mediated GSH-R1a signaling on peripheral energy balance and
      cognitive function. We will also discuss the potential pharmacotherapeutic
      role of GSH-R1a-mediated ghrelin signaling for the treatment of complex
      neuroendocrine disorders.

TI  - The Mammalian Tachykinin Ligand-Receptor System: An Emerging Target for
      Central Neurological Disorders.
AB  - Our understanding of the complex signaling neurophysiology of the central
      nervous system has facilitated the exploration of potential novel
      receptor-ligand system targets for disorders of this most complex organ.
      In recent years, many relatively neglected receptor-ligand systems have
      been re-evaluated with respect to their ability to potently modulate
      discrete tracts in the central nervous system. One such system is the
      tachykinin (previously neurokinin) system. The multiple heptahelical G
      protein-coupled receptors and neuropeptide ligands that comprise this
      system may be significantly involved in more central nervous systems
      actions than previously thought, including sleep disorders, amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Machado-Joseph disease. The
      development of our understanding of the role of the tachykinin
      receptor-ligand system in higher order central functions is likely to
      allow the creation of more specific and selective tachykinin-related
      neurotherapeutics.

TI  - Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor System: Modulatory Role in Aging
      and Neurodegeneration.
AB  - Receptors for hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are
      expressed throughout the brain. Age-related decline in gonadal
      reproductive hormones cause imbalances of this axis and many hormones in
      this axis have been functionally linked to neurodegenerative
      pathophysiology. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) plays a vital role
      in both central and peripheral reproductive regulation. GnRH has
      historically been known as a pituitary hormone; however, in the past few
      years, interest has been raised in GnRH actions at non-pituitary
      peripheral targets. GnRH ligands and receptors are found throughout the
      brain where they may act to control multiple higher functions such as
      learning and memory function and feeding behavior. The actions of GnRH in
      mammals are mediated by the activation of a unique rhodopsin-like G
      protein-coupled receptor that does not possess a cytoplasmic carboxyl
      terminal sequence. Activation of this receptor appears to mediate a wide
      variety of signaling mechanisms that show diversity in different tissues.
      Epidemiological support for a role of GnRH in central functions is
      evidenced by a reduction in neurodegenerative disease after GnRH agonist
      therapy. It has previously been considered that these effects were not via
      direct GnRH action in the brain, however recent data has pointed to a
      direct central action of these ligands outside the pituitary. We have
      therefore summarized the evidence supporting a central direct role of GnRH
      ligands and receptors in controlling central nervous physiology and
      pathophysiology.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide and its Receptors
      in Neurological Disorders.
AB  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a basic 28 amino acid peptide that
      binds to a member of the class II family of G protein-coupled receptors
      (GPCRs). It is widely expressed throughout the body and plays an important
      role in numerous biological functions. VIP acts via three different GPCRs:
      VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1, which have been identified in various tissues,
      including brain, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, tongue, and also on
      immunocompetent cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes. There is
      mounting evidence that VIP expression and signaling is altered in numerous
      neurological disorders, and it is becoming apparent that VIP and its
      receptors could be therapeutic loci for the treatment of several
      pathological conditions of the central nervous system. In this review, we
      describe the pathology of several major neurological disorders and discuss
      the potential pharmacotherapeutic role of VIP and its receptors for the
      treatment of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
      and Autism Spectrum Disorders.

TI  - Exogenous methyl jasmonate diminishes the formation of lipid-derived
      compounds in boiled potato (Solanum tuberosum L.).
AB  - BACKGROUND: During potato storage the tubers tend to develop off-flavours,
      mainly due to lipid-derived aldehydes, whose formation is increased after
      boiling or processing. This may become a problem when boiled or precooked
      potatoes are used. Methyl jasmonate (MJ) is a phytohormone capable of
      modifying plant and food composition. The aim of this work was to control
      the formation of off-flavours in different cultivars of raw potato during
      storage by MJ treatment.RESULTS: The use of Carbowax 20M as support in MJ
      emulsion resulted in significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower levels of
      lipid-derived compounds than the use of lanolin. Levels of the
      lipid-derived aldehydes propanal, hep-2-enal, nonanal, oct-2-enal and
      hexanal, although dependent on variety, generally decreased significantly
      (P &lt; 0.05) after treatment with MJ/Carbowax 20M emulsion. Sugar-derived
      compounds such as pyridine and furfural, however, were not affected by
      this treatment.CONCLUSION: Treatment with MJ/Carbowax 20M can be used to
      diminish the formation of off-flavours in boiled potato. However, this
      treatment is not useful to avoid the sweetening caused by sugar-derived
      products. Additional advantages of exogenous MJ are a delay in the
      appearance of sprouting and aging and hence prolongation of the storage
      life of potato tubers. Copyright (c) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - [Problems of pain measurement and pain therapy in the elderly]
PG  - 235-46
AB  - Due to complex physical and psychological changes in aging, pain
      measurement and therapeutic treatment of older and geriatric patients
      present a special challenge. Nevertheless, even for this category of
      patients, good treatment results are achievable if age-related particulars
      and problems are consistently heeded and accounted for. That includes
      adverse sensory and cognitive effects as much as multimorbidity and the
      polypharmacy that is frequently related to it. An essential prerequisite
      for adequate pain therapeutic care in elderly patients is consistent pain
      measurement. While numerical and verbal scales have also proven their
      usefulness for patients in advanced age who are not cognitively impaired,
      instruments must be applied for older people with communicative and/or
      cognitive restrictions with which the observed behavior of those involved
      can be surveyed in a multidimensional way.

TI  - Increased Cerebrospinal Fluid F(2)-Isoprostanes are Associated with Aging
      and Latent Alzheimer's Disease as Identified by Biomarkers.
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common age-related chronic illness with
      latent, prodrome, and fully symptomatic dementia stages. Increased free
      radical injury to regions of brain is one feature of prodrome and dementia
      stages of AD; however, it also is associated with advancing age. This
      raises the possibility that age-related free radical injury to brain might
      be caused in part or in full by latent AD. We quantified free radical
      injury in the central nervous system with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      F(2)-isoprostanes (IsoPs) in 421 clinically normal individuals and
      observed a significant increase over the adult human lifespan (P &lt; 0.001).
      Using CSF amyloid (A) beta(42) and tau, we defined normality using results
      from 28 clinically normal individuals &lt;50 years old, and then stratified
      74 clinically normal subjects &gt;/=60 years into those with CSF that had
      normal CSF Abeta(42) and tau (n = 37); abnormal CSF Abeta(42) and tau, the
      biomarker signature of AD (n = 24); decreased Abeta(42) only (n = 4); or
      increased tau only (n = 9). Increased CSF F(2)-IsoPs were present in
      clinically normal subjects with the biomarker signature of AD (P &lt; 0.05)
      and those subjects with increased CSF tau (P &lt; 0.001). Finally, we
      analyzed the relationship between age and CSF F(2)-IsoPs for those
      clinically normal adults with normal CSF (n = 37) and those with abnormal
      CSF Abeta(42) and/or tau (n = 37); only those with normal CSF demonstrated
      a significant increase with age (P &lt; 0.01). These results show that CSF
      F(2)-IsoPs increased across the human lifespan and that this age-related
      increase in free radical injury to brain persisted after culling those

TI  - Postural control while dressing on two surfaces in the elderly.
AB  - Falling is a worldwide problem faced by the elderly, and it has serious
      consequences. The elderly falls in the bathroom very often, and this
      raises the concern of the connection between the high incidence of falls
      in the bathroom and postural control of putting on shorts. Because little
      is known about postural control while putting on shorts of any age group,
      this study investigated the effects of age and surface on postural control
      while putting on shorts. Healthy young adults (n = 15; age range: 21-27
      years) and the elderly participants (n = 15; age range: 63-78 years) were
      compared in the temporal-spatial parameters, movement of center of mass
      (COM), and its interactions with center of pressure (COP) and kinematic
      measures under two conditions: anti-slipping mat and tile. The results
      demonstrated that the elderly had lengthened cycle time, decreased
      single-limb-support ratio, decreased medial-lateral velocity of COM,
      decreased relative displacement between COM and COP, decreased hip
      abduction-adduction angle, knee flexion angle, and the height of foot
      elevation. The elderly demonstrated a conservative strategy that may
      reduce the mechanical load on the supporting limb but preserve
      medial-lateral balance during the task. The adopted strategy may be
      relevant to the reduction of muscle strength and proprioception loss
      during natural aging process. Although surface did not affect the motion
      patterns of participants while putting on shorts, the slippery surface
      should be avoided. Other environmental modification such as a grab bar and
      bright illumination may have advantages in reducing the risk of falls.

TI  - Acute kidney injury in elderly intensive care patients: a review.
AB  - The elderly are at high risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). With the aging
      of the population, the demand for intensive care unit (ICU) admission from
      older patients will continue to rise, and this clinical entity will likely
      become increasingly common. In this article we review the relevant
      literature, discuss the age-related changes that render older people prone
      to AKI development, and examine the most frequent etiologies for renal
      impairment in these patients. We also consider the difficulties in
      achieving an early diagnosis in the elderly ICU patient, the
      particularities related to AKI treatment in this age group, and the data
      available on differences in renal recovery and mortality between the young
      and the old with renal injury. More importantly, we highlight the methods
      for prevention of AKI development or worsening in the elderly critically
      ill patient.

TI  - Modulation of Presynaptic GABA Release by Oxidative Stress in
      Mechanically-isolated Rat Cerebral Cortical Neurons.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)),
      the superoxide anion (O(2) (-).), and the hydroxyl radical (OH.), are
      generated as by-products of oxidative metabolism in cells. The cerebral
      cortex has been found to be particularly vulnerable to production of ROS
      associated with conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion, Parkinson's
      disease, and aging. To investigate the effect of ROS on inhibitory
      GABAergic synaptic transmission, we examined the electrophysiological
      mechanisms of the modulatory effect of H(2)O(2) on GABAergic miniature
      inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSCs) in mechanically isolated rat
      cerebral cortical neurons retaining intact synaptic boutons. The membrane
      potential was voltage-clamped at -60 mV and mIPSCs were recorded and
      analyzed. Superfusion of 1-mM H(2)O(2) gradually potentiated mIPSCs. This
      potentiating effect of H(2)O(2) was blocked by the pretreatment with
      either 10,000-unit/mL catalase or 300-microM N-acetyl-cysteine. The
      potentiating effect of H(2)O(2) was occluded by an adenylate cyclase
      activator, forskolin, and was blocked by a protein kinase A inhibitor,
      N-(2-[p-bromocinnamylamino] ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide
      hydrochloride. This study indicates that oxidative stress may potentiate
      presynaptic GABA release through the mechanism of cAMP-dependent protein
      kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathways, which may result in the inhibition of
      the cerebral cortex neuronal activity.

TI  - Neural substrates of reliability-weighted visual-tactile multisensory
      integration.
PG  - 25
AB  - As sensory systems deteriorate in aging or disease, the brain must relearn
      the appropriate weights to assign each modality during multisensory
      integration. Using blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic
      resonance imaging of human subjects, we tested a model for the neural
      mechanisms of sensory weighting, termed "weighted connections." This model
      holds that the connection weights between early and late areas vary
      depending on the reliability of the modality, independent of the level of
      early sensory cortex activity. When subjects detected viewed and felt
      touches to the hand, a network of brain areas was active, including visual
      areas in lateral occipital cortex, somatosensory areas in inferior
      parietal lobe, and multisensory areas in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS).
      In agreement with the weighted connection model, the connection weight
      measured with structural equation modeling between somatosensory cortex
      and IPS increased for somatosensory-reliable stimuli, and the connection
      weight between visual cortex and IPS increased for visual-reliable
      stimuli. This double dissociation of connection strengths was similar to
      the pattern of behavioral responses during incongruent multisensory
      stimulation, suggesting that weighted connections may be a neural
      mechanism for behavioral reliability weighting.

TI  - NSAIDs and cardiovascular disease: transducing human pharmacology results
      into clinical read-outs in the general population.
PG  - 530-5
AB  - Traditional (t) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
      selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors (coxibs) are important and
      efficacious drugs for the management of musculoskeletal symptoms. These
      drugs have both beneficial and adverse effects due to the inhibition of
      prostanoids. Although the tNSAID and coxib inhibition of COX-2-dependent
      prostaglandin (PG)E(2) production is effective in ameliorating symptoms of
      inflammation and pain, a small but consistent increased risk of myocardial
      infarction has been detected in association with their use. Convincing
      evidence suggests that cardiovascular toxicity associated with the
      administration of these compounds occurs through a common mechanism
      involving inhibition of COX-2-dependent prostacyclin. The development of
      biomarkers that predict the impact of NSAIDs on COX-1 and COX-2 activities
      in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo has been essential to read-out the clinical
      consequences of the varying degrees of inhibition of the two COX-isozymes
      in humans. Whole blood assays for COX-1 and COX-2 might be candidates as
      surrogate end-points of toxicity and efficacy of NSAIDs. Using a biomarker
      strategy, we have shown that the degree of inhibition of COX-2 and the
      functional selectivity with which it is achieved are relevant to the level
      of cardiovascular hazard from NSAIDs and relate to drug potency
      (exposure). We propose that the assessment of COX-2 in whole blood ex
      vivo, either alone or in combination with urinary levels of
      2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) a biomarker of prostacyclin biosynthesis in
      vivo, may represent a valid surrogate end-point to predict cardiovascular
      risk for functionally selective COX-2 inhibitors.

TI  - Elevated Mcl-1 perturbs lymphopoiesis, promotes transformation of
      hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and enhances drug-resistance.
AB  - Diverse human cancers with poor prognosis, including many lymphoid and
      myeloid malignancies, exhibit high levels of Mcl-1. To explore the impact
      of Mcl-1 over-expression on the hematopoietic compartment, we have
      generated vavP-mcl-1 transgenic mice. Their lymphoid and myeloid cells
      displayed increased resistance to a variety of cytotoxic agents.
      Myelopoiesis was relatively normal, but lymphopoiesis was clearly
      perturbed, with excess mature B and T cells accumulating. Rather than the
      follicular lymphomas typical of vavP-BCL-2 mice, aging vavP-mcl-1 mice
      were primarily susceptible to lymphomas having the phenotype of a
      stem/progenitor cell (11/30 tumors) or pre-B cell (12/30 tumors). Mcl-1
      over-expression dramatically accelerated Myc-driven lymphomagenesis. Most
      vavP-mcl-1/ Emu-myc mice died around birth and transplantation of blood
      from bitransgenic E18 embryos into unirradiated mice resulted in
      stem/progenitor cell tumors. Furthermore, lethally irradiated mice
      transplanted with E13 fetal liver cells from mcl-1/myc bitransgenic mice
      uniformly succumbed to stem/progenitor cell tumors. When treated in vivo
      with cyclophosphamide, tumors co-expressing mcl-1 and myc transgenes were
      significantly more resistant than conventional Emu-myc lymphomas.
      Collectively, these results demonstrate that Mcl-1 over-expression renders
      hematopoietic cells refractory to many cytotoxic insults, perturbs
      lymphopoiesis and promotes malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem
      and progenitor cells.

TI  - The QKI-6 RNA Binding Protein Regulates AIP-1 mRNA Stability during
      Oligodendrocyte Differentiation.
AB  - Monitoring Editor: Marvin Wickens The quaking viable (qk(v)) mice
      represent an animal model of dysmyelination. The absence of expression of
      the QKI-6 and QKI-7 cytoplasmic isoforms in oligodendrocytes (OL) during
      CNS (CNS) myelination causes the qk(v) mouse phenotype. The QKI RNA
      binding proteins are known to regulate RNA metabolism of cell cycle
      proteins and myelin components in OLs, however, little is known of their
      role in reorganizing the cytoskeleton or process outgrowth during OL
      maturation and differentiation. Herein we identify the actin-interacting
      protein (AIP-1) mRNA as a target of QKI-6 using two-dimensional
      differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). The AIP-1 mRNA contains a
      consensus QKI response element (QRE) within its 3'-UTR that, when bound by
      QKI-6, decreases the half-life of the AIP-1 mRNA. While the expression of
      QKI-6 is known to increase during OL differentiation and CNS myelination,
      we show that this increase is paralleled with a corresponding decrease in
      AIP-1 expression in rat brains. Furthermore, qk(v)/qk(v) mice that lack
      QKI-6 and QKI-7 within its OLs, had an increased level of AIP-1 in OLs.
      Moreover, primary rat OL precursors harboring an AIP-1 siRNA display
      defects in OL process outgrowth. Our findings suggest that the QKI RNA
      binding proteins regulate OL differentiation by modulating the expression
      of AIP-1.

TI  - Pharmacological and genetic reversal of age-dependent cognitive deficits
      attributable to decreased presenilin function.
PG  - 9510-22
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of cognitive loss and
      neurodegeneration in the developed world. Although its genetic and
      environmental causes are not generally known, familial forms of the
      disease (FAD) are attributable to mutations in a single copy of the
      Presenilin (PS) and amyloid precursor protein genes. The dominant
      inheritance pattern of FAD indicates that it may be attributable to gain
      or change of function mutations. Studies of FAD-linked forms of presenilin
      (psn) in model organisms, however, indicate that they are loss of
      function, leading to the possibility that a reduction in PS activity might
      contribute to FAD and that proper psn levels are important for maintaining
      normal cognition throughout life. To explore this issue further, we have
      tested the effect of reducing psn activity during aging in Drosophila
      melanogaster males. We have found that flies in which the dosage of psn
      function is reduced by 50% display age-onset impairments in learning and
      memory. Treatment with metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonists
      or lithium during the aging process prevented the onset of these deficits,
      and treatment of aged flies reversed the age-dependent deficits. Genetic
      reduction of Drosophila metabotropic glutamate receptor (DmGluRA), the
      inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R), or inositol polyphosphate
      1-phosphatase also prevented these age-onset cognitive deficits. These
      findings suggest that reduced psn activity may contribute to the age-onset
      cognitive loss observed with FAD. They also indicate that enhanced mGluR
      signaling and calcium release regulated by InsP(3)R as underlying causes
      of the age-dependent cognitive phenotypes observed when psn activity is
      reduced.

TI  - The demographic and biomedical case for late-life interventions in aging.
PG  - 40cm21
AB  - The social and medical costs of the biological aging process are high and
      will rise rapidly in coming decades, creating an enormous challenge to
      societies worldwide. In recent decades, researchers have expanded their
      understanding of the underlying deleterious structural and physiological
      changes (aging damage) that underlie the progressive functional
      impairments, declining health, and rising mortality of aging humans and
      other organisms and have been able to intervene in the process in model
      organisms, even late in life. To preempt a global aging crisis, we
      advocate an ambitious global initiative to translate these findings into
      interventions for aging humans, using three complementary approaches to
      retard, arrest, and even reverse aging damage, extending and even
      restoring the period of youthful health and functionality of older people.

TI  - Spatial uncoupling of biodegradation, soil respiration, and PAH
      concentration in a creosote contaminated soil.
AB  - Hotspots and coldspots of concentration and biodegradation of polycyclic
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) marginally overlapped at the 0.5-100 m scale
      in a creosote contaminated soil in southern Sweden, suggesting that
      concentration and biodegradation had little spatial co-variation.
      Biodegradation was substantial and its spatial variability considerable
      and highly irregular, but it had no spatial autocorrelation. The soil
      concentration of PAHs explained only 20-30% of the variance of their
      biodegradation. Soil respiration was spatially autocorrelated. The spatial
      uncoupling between biodegradation and soil respiration seemed to be
      governed by the aging of PAHs in the soil, since biodegradation of added
      (13)C phenanthrene covaried with both soil respiration and microbial
      biomass. The latter two were also correlated with high concentrations of
      phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) that are common in gram-negative
      bacteria. However, several of the hotspots of biodegradation coincided
      with hotspots for the distribution of a PLFA indicative of fungal biomass.

TI  - Gold nanoparticles conjugated to benzoylmercaptoacetyltriglycine and
      l-cysteine methylester.
AB  - Benzoyl-protected mercaptoacetyltriglycine, a synthetic precursor used in
      the preparation of Technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine, a
      radiopharmaceutical for renal tubular function and l-cysteine methylester,
      a small, non-zwitterionic amino acid derivative, were used as capping
      agents of gold nanoparticles obtained by borohydride reduction method. The
      capped gold nanoparticles composites were prepared from aqueous solutions
      and characterized by UV-Vis, infrared and Raman spectra and Transmission
      Electron Microscopy images. The presence of the ligands and its different
      binding mode to the particles as a consequence of the benzoyl-protection
      of the thiol group in benzoyl-protected mercaptoacetyltriglycine were
      evidenced from infrared and Raman spectra. The stability on aging in water
      solution of the formed composites is discussed from the obtained UV-Vis
      spectra.

TI  - Social vulnerability predicts cognitive decline in a prospective cohort of
      older Canadians.
PG  - 319-325.e1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although numerous social factors have been associated with
      cognition in older adults, these findings have been limited by the
      consideration of individual factors in isolation. We investigated whether
      social vulnerability, defined as an index comprising many social factors,
      is associated with cognitive decline. METHODS: In this secondary analysis
      of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, 2468 community-dwellers aged 70
      and older were followed up for 5 years. The social vulnerability index
      incorporated 40 social variables. Each response was scored as 0 if the
      "deficit" was absent and 1 if it was present; the 40 deficit scores were
      then summed. For some analyses, index scores were split into tertiles of
      high, intermediate, and low social vulnerability. Cognitive decline was
      defined as a &gt;or=5-point decline in the Modified Mini-Mental State
      Examination (3MS). Associations of social vulnerability with 5-year
      cognitive decline (adjusting for age, sex, frailty, and baseline
      cognition) were analyzed by using logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean
      social vulnerability was 0.25 (standard deviation, 0.09) or 9.9 deficits
      of the list of 40. The median cognitive change of -1.0 (interquartile
      range, -6 to 2) points on the 3MS was noted at 5 years. About 743
      individuals (30% of the sample) experienced a decline of &gt;or=5 points on
      the 3MS. Each additional social deficit was associated with increased odds
      of cognitive decline (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to
      1.06; P = .02). Compared with those with low social vulnerability,
      individuals with high social vulnerability had a 36% increased odds of
      experiencing cognitive decline (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval,
      1.06 to 1.74; P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing social vulnerability,
      defined by using a social vulnerability index incorporating many social
      factors, was associated with increased odds of cognitive decline during a
      period of 5 years in this study of older Canadians. Further study of
      social vulnerability in relation to cognition is warranted, with
      particular attention to potential interventions to alleviate its burden.

TI  - The effects of perceived stress and attitudes toward menopause and aging
      on symptoms of menopause.
PG  - 328-34
AB  - INTRODUCTION: As part of a longitudinal study of midlife women, the aim of
      this investigation was to describe the intensity of menopausal symptoms in
      relation to the level of perceived stress in a woman's life and her
      attitudes toward menopause and aging. METHODS: Data were collected on 347
      women between 40 and 50 years of age in Northern California who began the
      study while premenopausal. Women self-identified as African American,
      European American, or Mexican/Central American. Data collected over three
      time points in the first 12 months were used for this analysis. An
      investigator-developed tool for the perception of specific types of stress
      was used. Attitudes toward menopause and aging were measured using the
      Attitudes Toward Menopause and Attitude Toward Aging scales. Attitudes
      toward aging and menopause, perceived stress, and income were related to
      intensity of symptoms. RESULTS: There was no ethnic group difference in
      perceived stress or attitude toward menopause. However, European and
      African Americans had a more positive attitude toward aging than
      Mexican/Central Americans. DISCUSSION: A lower income, higher perceived
      stress, a more negative attitude toward aging, and a more positive
      attitude toward menopause influenced menopausal symptom experience.

TI  - Renal hemodynamic changes with aging: a preliminary study using CT
      perfusion in the healthy elderly.
PG  - 247-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate renal blood flow perfusion parameter changes
      associated with aging using multislice spiral computed tomography (CT).
      METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institute's ethics
      committee for clinical study and written informed consent was obtained
      from all subjects. Forty-two consecutive patients who underwent abdominal
      CT without obvious renal abnormality at plain scanning were enrolled in
      this study. The renal perfusion scan was carried out using 16-slice spiral
      CT. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the
      correlation between perfusion parameter changes with aging. RESULTS: In
      both the cortex and medulla, blood flow (BF) and blood volume (BV) were
      negatively correlated with age, while time-to-peak (TTP) value and mean
      transit time (MTT) showed a positive correlation with age. Changes in BF,
      TTP, and MTT were found to have a statistically significant correlation
      with age in both the cortex and medulla, while the correlation between BV
      and age showed no statistical significance. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to
      assess renal hemodynamics changes with aging in the elderly using the
      current clinically available CT perfusion imaging technology in vivo. It
      may be helpful in the management of aged patients to familiarize with the
      renal hemodynamics changes in clinical work-up.

TI  - Medical conditions of nursing home admissions.
PG  - 46
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: As long-term nursing home care is likely to increase
      with the aging of the population, identifying chronic medical conditions
      is of particular interest. Although need factors have a strong impact on
      nursing home (NH) admission, the diseases causing these functional
      disabilities are lacking or unclear in the residents' file. We
      investigated the medical reason (primary diagnosis) of a nursing home
      admission with respect to the underlying disease. METHODS: This study is
      based on two independent, descriptive and comparative studies in Belgium
      and was conducted at two time points (1993 and 2005) to explore the
      evolution over twelve years. Data from the subjects were extracted from
      the resident's file; additional information was requested from the general
      practitioner, nursing home physician or the head nurse in a face-to-face
      interview. In 1993 we examined 1332 residents from 19 institutions, and in
      2005 691 residents from 7 institutions. The diseases at the time of
      admission were mapped by means of the International Classification of
      Diseases - 9th edition (ICD-9). Longitudinal changes were assessed and
      compared by a chi-square test. RESULTS: The main chronic medical
      conditions associated with NH admission were dementia and stroke. Mental
      disorders represent 48% of all admissions, somatic disorders 43% and
      social/emotional problems 8%. Of the somatic disorders most frequently are
      mentioned diseases of the circulatory system (35%) [2/3 sequels of stroke
      and 1/5 heart failure], followed by diseases of the nervous system (15%)
      [mainly Parkinson's disease] and the musculoskeletal system (14%) [mainly
      osteoarthritis]. The most striking evolution from 1993 to 2005 consisted
      in complicated diabetes mellitus (from 4.3 to 11.4%; p&lt;0.0001) especially
      with amputations and blindness. Symptoms (functional limitations without
      specific disease) like dizziness, impaired vision and frailty are of
      relevance as an indicator of admission. CONCLUSION: Diseases like stroke,
      diabetes and mobility problems are only important for institutionalisation
      if they cause functional disability. Diabetes related complications as
      cause of admission increased almost three-fold between 1993 and 2005.

PG  - 435-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of menopausal symptoms of midlife
      Black women in the United States. DESIGN: Qualitative online forum using a
      feminist perspective. SETTING: Internet communities for midlife women and
      Blacks. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty midlife Black women recruited using a quota
      sampling method. METHODS: A 6-month online forum was conducted with seven
      discussion topics on menopausal symptoms. The discussion topics were
      posted sequentially on the forum site, and the women posted messages at
      their convenience over 6 months. The data were analyzed using thematic
      analysis. RESULTS: The identified themes were raised to be strong,
      accepting a natural aging process, silent and without knowledge, and our
      own experience. The women tried to be strong during their menopausal
      transitions while dealing with other important family matters. The women
      did not report their menopausal symptoms and were silent about or
      downplayed their symptoms, but many emphasized the importance of education
      about menopausal symptoms and highlighted their own lack of knowledge.
      These women generally did not talk about their symptoms because they
      believed that nobody except other Black midlife women could understand
      their menopausal experience. CONCLUSION: Health care providers need to
      develop a mechanism to deliver the necessary knowledge about menopausal
      symptoms and management strategies to Black midlife women in their health
      care practices.

      Case-comparison Study of Homicide Offenders Aged 60 Years or Older*
AB  - With populations aging there have been some concerns on elderly offending.
      We compared elderly homicide offenders with a younger comparison group
      with special emphasis on psychopathy. We analyzed nationwide
      register-based material on all homicide offenders aged 60 or older who
      were in a forensic psychiatric examination in Finland 1995-2004 and their
      gender-matched comparison group of younger homicide offenders. The
      offenders 60 years or older were diagnosed less often than the younger
      ones with drug dependence and personality disorders and more often with
      dementia and physical illnesses. The mean Psychopathy Checklist-Revised
      total scores as well as factor and facet scores were lower in the 60 or
      older age group. The group 60 years or older had significantly lower
      scores on eight individual items of social deviance. The
      interpersonal/affective factor 1 scores did not differ. Understanding the
      possible underlying phenomena of violent behavior may provide help for
      developing services for the elderly.

TI  - Mitophagy in yeast: actors and physiological roles.
AB  - Abstract Mitochondria are essential for oxidative energy production in
      aerobic eukaryotic cells, where they are also required for multiple
      biosynthetic pathways to take place. Mitochondria also monitor and
      evaluate complex information from the environment and intracellular
      milieu, including the presence or absence of growth factors, oxygen,
      reactive oxygen species, and DNA damage. It follows that disturbances of
      the integrity of mitochondrial function lead to the disruption of cell
      function, expressed as disease, aging, or cell death. It has been assumed
      that the degradation of damaged mitochondria by an autophagy-related
      pathway specific to mitochondria (mitophagy), recently found to be
      strictly regulated, is a fundamental process essential for cell
      homeostasis. Until now, the main role of mitophagy has been tentatively
      defined as a 'house-cleaning' pathway that allows to eliminate altered
      mitochondria, but mitophagy may also play a role in the adaptation of the
      number and quality of mitochondria to new environmental conditions. In
      yeast, recent data defined two categories of mitophagy actors: ones
      constitutively required for mitophagy and those with mitophagy-regulatory
      functions. Situations were also uncovered in normal physiology in which
      cells utilize mitophagy to eliminate damaged, dysfunctional, and
      superfluous mitochondria to adjust to changing physiological demands.

TI  - Treatment of Periorbital Wrinkles Using a 2,790-nm Yttrium Scandium
      Gallium Garnet Laser.
AB  - BACKGROUND Wrinkle formation usually accompanies skin aging. Periorbital
      wrinkles in particular are an early sign of skin aging. Therefore, several
      modalities have been developed to treat periorbital wrinkles, including
      topical applications, surgical techniques, and laser resurfacing. The
      2,790-nm yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) laser has been increasing
      in popularity recently, but there have been no investigations into the use
      of a 2,790-nm YSGG laser for the treatment of periorbital wrinkles.
      OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a 2,790-nm YSGG laser for
      treating periorbital wrinkles. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten Korean patients
      (Fitzpatrick skin type II-V) with periorbital wrinkles were enrolled in
      this study. They were treated two times with a 4-week interval using a
      2,790-nm YSGG laser. The treatment parameters were an average 2-J/cm(2)
      fluence, 6-mm spot size, and 0.3-ms pulse width. Treatment consisted of
      two to three passes of the laser with 20% overlap until a clinical end
      point of mild erythema was observed. Patients were examined 1 week after
      each treatment and 3 months after the last treatment. Two independent,
      blinded dermatologists evaluated clinical improvement using the
      Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Classification System (FWCS) by comparing digital
      photographs taken before treatment (baseline) and 3 months after the last
      treatment. Efficacy was assessed by subtracting the baseline score from
      the score at 3 months after the last treatment (wrinkle improvement&lt;0; no
      change=0; worsening&gt;0). At each visit, the patients were also evaluated
      for any side effects. At the end of the study, the patients documented
      their degree of satisfaction on a scale of very satisfied, satisfied,
      slightly satisfied, and unsatisfied. RESULTS All patients completed the
      two treatment sessions, and all experienced clinical improvement of
      periorbital wrinkles based on the physician assessments. The mean
      treatment efficacies for the right and left sides using the FWCS were
      -1.85+/-0.82 and -1.70+/-0.71, respectively. Nine of 10 participants were
      satisfied with the procedure. Transient hyperpigmentation and slight
      exfoliation were observed in one patient after the last treatment, but
      this disappeared within 10 weeks. CONCLUSION In treating periorbital
      wrinkles, a 2,790-nm YSGG laser treatment might be an effective treatment
      modality with minimal complications. The authors have indicated no
      significant interest with commercial supporters.

TI  - Effects of Long Term Culture on Human Embryonic Stem Cell Aging.
AB  - In recent years, human embryonic stem (hES) cells have become a promising
      cell source for regenerative medicine. Although hES cells have the ability
      for unlimited self-renewal, potential adverse effects of long-term cell
      culture upon hES cells must be investigated before therapeutic
      applications of hES cells can be realized. Here we investigated changes in
      molecular profiles associated with young (&lt;60 passages) and old (&gt;120
      passages) cells of the H9 hES cell line as well as young (&lt;85 passages)
      and old (&gt;120 passages) cells of the PKU1 hES cell line. Our results show
      that morphology, stem cell markers, and telomerase activity do not differ
      significantly between young and old passage cells. Cells from both age
      groups were also shown to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ
      layers upon spontaneous differentiation in vitro. Interestingly,
      mitochondrial dysfunction was found to occur with prolonged culture. Old
      passage cells of both the H9 and PKU1 lines were characterized by higher
      mitochondrial membrane potential, larger mitochondrial morphology, and
      higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) content compared to their younger
      counterparts. Teratomas derived from higher passage cells were also found
      to have an uneven preference for differentiation as compared to tumors
      derived from younger cells. These findings suggest that prolonged culture
      of hES cells may negatively impact mitochondrial function and possibly
      affect long-term pluripotency.

TI  - Volume rejuvenation of the face.
PG  - 198-202
AB  - Patient's desires for an un-operated look and shorter recovery times have
      lead to a blending of surgical and nonsurgical techniques to effect facial
      rejuvenation. Anatomical changes within the skeleton and soft tissue
      compartments are discussed. A brief review of adjunctive techniques to
      replace volume lost in aging is presented. These techniques (autologous
      fat grafting and injectable fillers) are contrasted with more involved
      surgical procedures (rhytidectomy and sub-periosteal mid-face lifting). In
      patients with mild jowling, the "liquid facelift" can approach the results
      seen in surgical face-lifting. In patients with significant jowling, the
      addition of volume replacement at the time of rhytidectomy enhances the
      rejuvenation. The addition of volume replacement at the time of
      rhytidectomy has the potential to allow less aggressive surgical
      dissections to accomplish a harmonious result.

TI  - Hiking on the geriatrics rotation.
PG  - 473-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Most geriatrics training emphasizes chronically ill, dying,
      demented, or institutionalized patients. While some programs link trainees
      to healthy older adults in interview settings, we developed an experience
      that exposes trainees to vigorously active seniors with the objective of
      demonstrating the physical capabilities of older adults. METHODS: We sent
      residents with a senior group (age 60s--80s) from a hiking club on a
      moderately difficult (1,700-foot climb) hike. Later, residents were asked
      if the experience was worthwhile and if so, what they learned. RESULTS:
      All residents reported the experience worthwhile. Most reported a new
      perception of older adults' physical capabilities.CONCLUSIONS: Exposing
      residents to active older adults may provide residents with new
      perceptions of healthy aging.

TI  - Caloric restriction attenuates the age-associated increase of
      adipose-derived stem cells but further reduces their proliferative
      capacity.
AB  - White adipose tissue is a promising source of mesenchymal stem cells.
      Currently, little is known about the effect of age and caloric restriction
      (CR) on adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). This is important for three
      reasons: firstly, age and CR cause extensive remodeling of WAT; it is
      currently unknown how this remodeling affects the resident stem cell
      population. Secondly, stem cell senescence has been theorized as one of
      the causes of aging and could reduce the utility of a stem cell as a
      reagent. Thirdly, the mechanism by which CR extends lifespan is currently
      not known, one theory postulates that CR maintains the resident stem cell
      population in youthful "fit" state. For the purpose of this study, we
      define ASC as lineage negative (lin(-))/CD34(+(low))/CD31(-). We show that
      aging increases the abundance of ASC and the expression of Cdkn2a 9.8-fold
      and Isl1 60.6-fold. This would suggest that aging causes an accumulation
      of non-replicative ASC. CR reduced the percentage of ASC in the lin(-) SVF
      while also reducing colony forming ability. Therefore, CR appears to have
      anti-proliferative effects on ASC that may be advantageous from the
      perspective of cancer, but our data raises the possibility that it may be
      disadvantageous for regenerative medicine applications.

TI  - Erectile tissue molecular alterations with aging-differential activation
      of the p42/44 MAP Kinase pathway.
AB  - Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem in aged men; however, the
      molecular events involved in aging ED remain unclear. To better
      characterize the effects of aging in the penis, we evaluated cavernosal
      tissue remodeling capability and the downstream activation of the
      intracellular signaling mediator mitogen-activated protein p42/44 kinase
      (p42/44 MAPK). We used male Wistar rats, which were divided in groups of
      2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months old. Penile tissues were harvested and
      processed for protein isolation and immunohistochemical analysis.
      Cavernosal viability was assessed by TUNEL assay, and proliferation was
      analyzed by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear
      antigen (PCNA). Immunolocalization of the activated form of p42/44 MAPK
      was evaluated by immunofluorescence, and changes in its phosphorylation
      status were quantified by western blotting. p42/44 phosphorylation profile
      was also assessed in situ in human young and elderly cavernosal samples.
      With the advancement of age, experimental cavernosal tissue remodeling was
      affected by an age-dependent unbalance between the rate of apoptosis and
      proliferation, in all erectile components. Moreover, this turnover
      alteration was accompanied by significant modifications in the activation
      profile of the downstream effector p42/44 MAPK. In the youngest corporeal
      samples, p42/44 was mostly activated at perivascular sites, potentially
      mediating cell survival/proliferation. However, in elderly experimental
      erectile tissue, p42/44 phosphorylation shifted to trabecular fibroblasts,
      indicating a potential role in extracellular matrix (ECM) production. More
      importantly, the same differential pattern of p42/44 activation was
      observed in human young and aged cavernosal fragments, suggesting a
      distinct function of this protein with aging. We provided evidence for the
      first time that with the advancement of age, there is a differential
      activation of p42/44 MAPK in cavernosal tissue, which may promote ECM
      expansion and fibrosis, therefore compromising erectile function in the
      elderly.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA mutations induce mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis
      and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle of mitochondrial DNA mutator mice.
PG  - e11468
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aging results in a progressive loss of skeletal muscle, a
      condition known as sarcopenia. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations
      accumulate with aging in skeletal muscle and correlate with muscle loss,
      although no causal relationship has been established.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the relationship between
      mtDNA mutations and sarcopenia at the gene expression and biochemical
      levels using a mouse model that expresses a proofreading-deficient version
      (D257A) of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase gamma, resulting in increased
      spontaneous mtDNA mutation rates. Gene expression profiling of D257A mice
      followed by Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (PAGE) indicates
      that the D257A mutation is associated with a profound downregulation of
      gene sets associated with mitochondrial function. At the biochemical
      level, sarcopenia in D257A mice is associated with a marked reduction
      (35-50%) in the content of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I, III
      and IV, all of which are partly encoded by mtDNA. D257A mice display
      impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics associated with compromised state-3
      respiration, lower ATP content and a resulting decrease in mitochondrial
      membrane potential (Deltapsim). Surprisingly, mitochondrial dysfunction
      was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) production or oxidative damage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
      These findings demonstrate that mutations in mtDNA can be causal in
      sarcopenia by affecting the assembly of functional ETC complexes, the lack
      of which provokes a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, without an
      increase in oxidative stress, and ultimately, skeletal muscle apoptosis

TI  - Factors impacting quality of life in women with fecal incontinence.
PG  - 1148-54
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterize differences in
      health-related quality of life among women presenting for treatment of
      fecal incontinence. METHODS: Among 155 women presenting for treatment of
      fecal incontinence in a specialty clinic, validated questionnaires
      measured impact on quality of life (Modified Manchester Health
      Questionnaire) and severity (the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index). Bowel
      symptoms, including frequency, urgency, and stool consistency, were
      ascertained. Comorbid diseases were self-reported. Linear regression
      models were constructed from significant univariate variables to examine
      differences observed in quality of life scores. RESULTS: The average age
      was 58.7 +/- 11.5 years, with no differences found in quality of life
      scores according to race, body mass index, or number of vaginal deliveries
      (P &gt; .05). Younger age, increased urinary incontinence symptoms, prior
      cholecystectomy, prior hysterectomy, and severity of bowel symptoms
      correlated with a negative impact on quality of life in univariate
      analysis (P &lt; .05). Average severity scores were 30.5 +/- 13.7, with
      moderate correlation seen with increasing severity and quality of life
      scores (R2 = 0.60). After controlling for severity, women had increased
      quality of life scores with more bowel urgency (15 points; 95% CI,
      8.1-21.2), harder stool consistency (10 points; 95% CI, 3.8-16.3), and
      prior hysterectomy (9 points; 95% CI, 2.7-15.4). CONCLUSION: Bowel
      symptoms and having undergone a hysterectomy had the greatest negative
      impact on quality of life in women seeking treatment for fecal
      incontinence. Targeting individualized treatments to improve bowel
      symptoms may improve quality of life for women with fecal incontinence.

      disorders in Parkinson disease.
LID - 42642 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI42642 [doi]
AB  - Gait disorders and postural instability, which are commonly observed in
      elderly patients with Parkinson disease (PD), respond poorly to
      dopaminergic agents used to treat other parkinsonian symptoms. The brain
      structures underlying gait disorders and falls in PD and aging remain to
      be characterized. Using functional MRI in healthy human subjects, we have
      shown here that activity of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR),
      which is composed of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the adjacent
      cuneiform nucleus, was modulated by the speed of imagined gait, with
      faster imagined gait activating a discrete cluster within the MLR.
      Furthermore, the presence of gait disorders in patients with PD and in
      aged monkeys rendered parkinsonian by MPTP intoxication correlated with
      loss of PPN cholinergic neurons. Bilateral lesioning of the cholinergic
      part of the PPN induced gait and postural deficits in nondopaminergic
      lesioned monkeys. Our data therefore reveal that the cholinergic neurons
      of the PPN play a central role in controlling gait and posture and
      represent a possible target for pharmacological treatment of gait
      disorders in PD.

TI  - Transportation and driving in longitudinal studies on ageing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: the associations between transportation, driving and
      successful ageing are as yet poorly understood. As longitudinal studies
      are the best methodology for clarifying associations and relationships
      between health, ageing and environmental factors, we sought to determine
      how transportation is incorporated into longitudinal studies, and which
      aspects are assessed. METHODS: of 55 longitudinal studies on ageing on the
      National Institute on Aging register, online survey instruments, where
      available, were scrutinised for references to transport. Where
      unavailable, principal investigators were contacted by mail/email/phone
      and asked to forward questions on transportation and driving. Questions
      were classified into (i) systems, (ii) resources, (iii) transport
      satisfaction and (iv) mobility needs. RESULTS: of 55 studies, we could
      review 36 questionnaires (28 personal replies, 9 accessible online survey
      instruments). Sixteen had no reference to driving or transportation, 20
      (61%) had public transport components and 12 (31%) included questions
      about driving. Questions covered systems (17), transportation needs (12),
      transportation resources (11) and transportation satisfaction (4).
      CONCLUSION: transport is under-represented in ongoing longitudinal
      studies, with emphases on public transport, systems and resources, rather
      than driving and satisfaction. Future waves of studies could usefully
      review their survey instruments to better measure older people's
      preferences on transport options and satisfaction.

TI  - Trends in Diabetes Medication Use and Prevalence of Geriatric Syndromes in
      Older Mexican Americans from 1993/1994 to 2004/2005(September).
AB  - BACKGROUND: New diabetes medications introduced over the last decade have
      led to changes in diabetes treatment recommendations for the increasing
      number of elderly patients with diabetes. It is, however, not clear
      whether these changes are accompanied by changes in prevalence of comorbid
      geriatric syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether changes in diabetes
      treatment between 1993/1994 and 2004/2005 were accompanied by changes in
      prevalence of geriatric syndromes in Mexican Americans aged 75 years and
      older. METHODS: Data from the Hispanic Established Population for the
      Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly were used. Participants aged 75 years
      and older with diabetes in 1993/1994 (n = 284) and in 2004/2005 (n = 324;
      new cohort added in 2004/2005) were included in the analyses. Medication
      use and geriatric syndromes prevalence rates were estimated and compared
      using descriptive and univariate statistics for continuous variables and
      contingency tables (chi(2)) for categorical variables. RESULTS: Older
      Mexican Americans with diabetes in 2004/2005 were more likely to be taking
      2 or more oral diabetes medications than were those in the 1993/1994
      cohort; most of the drugs taken by the 2004/2005 cohort were the newly
      introduced oral diabetes medications. Use of insulin as sole diabetes
      therapy decreased from 20.3% in the 1993/1994 cohort to 7.5% in the
      2004/2005 cohort. The 2004/2005 cohort reported longer diabetes duration
      and higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension; they were also more
      likely than the 1993/1994 cohort to have more geriatric syndromes: pain,
      arthritis, incontinence, and self-reported activities of daily living
      disability. No significant differences exist between the 2 cohorts in
      objective measures of cognitive and physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Older
      Mexican Americans with diabetes in 2004/2005 used more of the newer
      diabetes medications and less insulin compared to the 1993/1994 cohort.
      The prevalence rates of geriatric syndromes were higher in the 2004/2005
      cohort. Our findings suggest that screening for and treating comorbid
      geriatric syndromes is increasingly important for optimal geriatric
      diabetes care.

TI  - G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 2 (GRK2) PLAYS A RELEVANT ROLE IN
      INSULIN RESISTANCE AND OBESITY.
AB  - AbstractObjective - Insulin resistance is associated with the pathogenesis
      of metabolic disorders as type-2-diabetes and obesity. Given the emerging
      role of signal transduction in these syndromes, we set out to explore the
      possible role that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), first
      identified as a G protein-coupled receptor regulator, could have as a
      modulator of insulin responses. Research Design and Methods - We analyzed
      the influence of GRK2 levels in insulin signaling in myoblasts and
      adipocytes with experimentally increased or silenced levels of GRK2, and
      in GRK2 hemizygous animals expressing 50% lower levels of this kinase in
      three different models of insulin resistance: TNFalpha infusion, aging and
      high fat diet (HFD). Glucose transport, whole body glucose and insulin
      tolerance, the activation status of insulin pathway components, and the
      circulating levels of important mediators were measured. The development
      of obesity and adipocyte size with age and HFD was analyzed. Results -
      Altering GRK2 levels markedly modifies insulin-mediated signaling in
      cultured adipocytes and myocytes. GRK2 levels are increased by
      approximately 2-fold in muscle and adipose tissue in the animal models
      tested, and in lymphocytes from metabolic syndrome patients. In contrast,
      hemizygous GRK2 mice show enhanced insulin sensitivity and do not develop
      insulin resistance by TNFalpha, aging or HFD. Furthermore, reduced GRK2
      levels induce a lean phenotype and decrease age-related adiposity.
      Conclusions - Overall, our data identify GRK2 as an important negative
      regulator of insulin effects, key to the etiopathogenesis of insulin
      resistance and obesity, what uncovers this protein as a potential
      therapeutic target in the treatment of these disorders.

TI  - Long-acting anticholinesterases for myasthenia gravis: synthesis and
      activities of quaternary phenylcarbamates of neostigmine, pyridostigmine
      and physostigmine.
AB  - The N-monophenylcarbamate analogues of neostigmine methyl sulfate (6) and
      pyridostigmine bromide (8) together with their precursors (5), (7), and
      the N(1)-methylammonium analogues of (-)-phenserine (12), (-)-tolserine
      (14), (-)-cymserine (16) and (-)-phenethylcymserine (18) were synthesized
      to produce long-acting peripheral inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase or
      butyrylcholinesterase. Evaluation of their cholinesterase inhibition
      against human enzyme ex vivo demonstrated that, whereas compounds 5-8
      possessed only marginal activity, 12, 14, 16 and 18 proved to be potent
      anticholinesterases. An extended duration of cholinesterase inhibition was
      determined in rodent, making them of potential interest as long-acting
      agents for myasthenia gravis.

TI  - Antioxidants: Benefits and risks for long-term health.
AB  - The oxidative modification hypothesis postulates that oxidative stress is
      one of the major factors in aging and the development of age-related
      disorders, including cardiovascular diseases. In this scenario, the
      oxidative modification of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids in vascular
      walls contributes to the etiology of cardiovascular disease, implying that
      consumption or therapeutic use of antioxidants could prevent the onset of
      such pathological disorders. Because of this, a number of studies have
      been conducted to address the question of whether cardiovascular diseases
      can be modulated by antioxidant treatment or consumption. Although some of
      the earliest data, collected in animal studies and epidemiologic studies
      have shown a measure of success, numerous clinical trials indicate that
      this approach is of minimal or no benefit. These conclusions represent a
      challenge to design more sensitive antioxidant trials in order to confirm
      or alter these conclusions. The focus of this review is on the benefits
      and disadvantages associated with the use of antioxidants, such as
      vitamins C and E, polyphenols, or antioxidant therapies, including hormone
      replacement therapy and iron reduction therapy, on overall vascular
      health.

TI  - Processes controlling the variations of pH, alkalinity, and CO2 partial
      pressure in the porewater of coal ash disposal site.
PG  - 74-81
AB  - Alkalinity, pH, and pCO2 are generally regarded as the most important
      parameters affecting trace element leaching from coal ashes. However,
      little is known about how those parameters are actually regulated in the
      field condition. This study investigated the processes controlling those
      parameters by observing undisturbed porewater chemistry in a closed ash
      disposal site. The site is now covered with 30-50 cm thick soils according
      to the management scheme suggested by the Waste Management Law of Korea
      and our results show the important role of soil cover regulating those
      parameters in the shallow porewater. Without the soil cover, the shallow
      porewater shows low pCO2 and alkalinity, and highly alkaline pH. In
      contrast, the porewater shows much higher alkalinity and near neutral pH
      range when the site was covered with the low permeability soils. This
      difference was caused by the CO2 supply condition changes associated with
      the changes in infiltration rate. The geochemical modeling shows that the
      calcite precipitations induced by porewater aging, dolomitization, and
      weathering of solid phases are the main processes controlling alkalinity,
      pH, and pCO2 in the deep saline porewaters. The weathering of coal ash
      plays the most important role decreasing the alkalinity in the deep
      porewater.

TI  - Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate is inversely associated with sex-dependent
      diverse carotid atherosclerosis regardless of endothelial function.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is thought to be
      associated with life expectancy and anti-aging. However, its biological
      significance in atherosclerosis remains controversial. Therefore, the aim
      of this study was to determine whether DHEAS is associated with
      development of carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with cardiovascular
      risk factors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 419 Japanese individuals
      (208 males and 211 females) were recruited from Tokushima University
      Hospital, Japan. In all subjects, maximum intima-media thickness (max-IMT)
      in all carotid arteries, and mean-IMT and mean blood flow volume (BFV) in
      the common carotid arteries (CCA) were measured by ultrasonography;
      endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation of the
      brachial artery (%FMD). Serum DHEAS and classical cardiovascular risk
      factors were also evaluated. Statistical significance was determined by
      multiple regression analysis to elucidate independent determinants of
      max-IMT, mean-IMT, mean CCA-BFV, and %FMD. RESULTS: Serum DHEAS levels
      were higher in males than in females. Multiple regression analysis
      revealed that DHEAS was an independent negative factor for both max-IMT
      and mean-IMT in males but not in females. In contrast, DHEAS was the sole
      positive factor for mean CCA-BFV in females but not in males. In addition,
      there was no significant relationship between %FMD and DHEAS regardless of
      sex and other confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Although DHEAS is not
      involved in endothelial function, DHEAS is inversely associated with
      sex-dependent diverse carotid atherosclerosis such as increased max-IMT
      and mean-IMT in males and decreased CCA-BFV in females.

TI  - Functionality and mortality in obese nursing home residents: an example of
      'risk factor paradox'?
PG  - 428-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the percentage of obese nursing home residents is
      increasing, few longitudinal studies have reported on functionality and
      mortality in this subpopulation. The aim of the present study was to
      explore functionality and mortality in obese nursing home residents during
      a 1-year follow-up and to compare these results with those of residents
      within the normal and low BMI range. METHODS: Two hundred residents (147
      female, 53 male, mean age 85.6 +/- 7.8 years) from 2 Nuremberg nursing
      homes were included. Body weight and height were measured in all
      participants. BMI was calculated and categorized as low (&lt;20 kg/m(2)),
      normal (20-30 kg/m(2)), and high (&gt;30 kg/m(2)). Handgrip strength, timed
      "up and go" test, and Barthel's Activities of Daily Living were applied as
      functional parameters. All measurements were done at baseline and after a
      1-year follow-up. RESULTS: At baseline, the prevalence of obesity was
      23.5%, whereas low BMI values were present in 8.5% of the residents. After
      1 year, there was no significant decline of functionality in the obese
      group, whereas functional parameters deteriorated significantly in study
      participants with normal BMI. One-year mortality was lowest in the obese
      (12.8%), with no deaths in residents with BMI of 35 kg/m(2) or higher.
      Mortality was highest in residents with low BMI (58.8%). CONCLUSION: In
      nursing home residents, obesity is associated with increased survival and
      stable functionality. These observations may therefore be regarded as an
      expression of "risk factor paradox" in this specific population of older
      individuals.

TI  - Long-term deprivation of gonadal hormone accelerates brain aging in mice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of long-term
      deprivation of gonadal hormone on brain aging in mice to develop a model
      of gonadectomy-accelerated brain aging. METHODS: Male and female mice at 2
      months old were orchiectomized (ORX) or ovarectomized (OVX) bilaterally or
      sham operated, and then they were fed for 10 months. The spatial learning
      and memory ability was tested using Morris Water Maze. The biomarkers of
      brain neuropathology were examined by Western blotting and
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Ovarectomy mildly impaired spatial learning
      and memory of mice, while the impairment in ORXmice was not significant.
      The amount of Nissl bodies decreased in the hippocampus and cortex of
      gonadectomied mice. The expression of beta-amyloid (Abeta), beta-site APP
      cleaving enzyme 1 and phosphorylated-Tau increased in gonadectomied mice.
      Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      decreased in the brain of OVX-mice, but neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) showed no
      change. We detected no decrease of NGF, BDNF or NT-3 in ORX-mice. TrkA
      expression decreased and p75(NTR) increased in the brain of gonadectomied
      mice. In all the above tests, there were no significant differences
      between young (2 months old) and sham operated (12 months old) mice.
      Alternations in the brain aging parameters were more obvious in OVX-mice
      than in ORX-mice. CONCLUSION: Long-term gonadal hormone deprivation by
      young-age gonadectomy accelerated mouse brain aging, which could serve as
      a valuable mouse model to study brain aging and aging-related pathological
      changes.

TI  - Conceptualization and nursing implications of self-imposed activity
      limitation among community-dwelling elders.
PG  - 353-61
AB  - The purposes of this paper are to explore, from a theoretical perspective,
      explanations for why some community-dwelling elders self-impose activity
      limitations (SIALs); to develop an integrated explanation for SIAL from a
      nursing perspective; and to identify some clinical implications of
      relevance to public health nursing practice. Activity limitation is an
      important risk factor for functional decline, morbidity, and mortality
      among community-dwelling elders. Many studies have focused on disease and
      environmental influences on activity limitations. The intrinsic processes
      associated with voluntary or SIAL in old age among otherwise physically
      and mentally capable elders are poorly understood and little studied. The
      conceptualization of SIAL provides nurses with an understanding of an
      understudied aging phenomenon and helps nurses understand how elders see
      activities related to their life priorities. The conceptual framework will
      facilitate future qualitative and quantitative study of SIAL, assist
      nurses in the development of a new gerontological nursing theory, and
      design of interventions for elders with activity limitations. Public
      health nurses with a better understanding of SIAL may be able to help
      elders improve or maintain their independence.

TI  - The migration of mitochondrial DNA fragments to the nucleus affects the
      chronological aging process of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - Summary Migration of fragmented mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the nucleus
      has been shown to occur in multiple species including yeast, plants, and
      mammals. Several human diseases, including Pallister-Hall syndrome and
      mucolipidosis, can be initiated by mtDNA insertion mutagenesis of nuclear
      DNA. In yeast, we demonstrated that the rate of mtDNA fragments
      translocating to the nucleus increases during chronological aging. The
      yeast chronological life span (CLS) is determined by the survival of
      non-dividing cell populations. Whereas yeast strains with elevated
      migration rates of mtDNA fragments to the nucleus showed accelerated
      chronological aging, strains with decreased mtDNA transfer rates to the
      nucleus exhibited an extended CLS. Although one of the most popular
      theories of aging is the free radical theory, migration of mtDNA fragments
      to the nucleus may also contribute to the chronological aging process by
      possibly increasing nuclear genomic instability in cells with advanced
      age.

TI  - Cyclophilin D links programmed cell death and organismal aging in
      Podospora anserina.
AB  - Summary Cyclophilin D (CYPD) is a mitochondrial peptidyl
      prolyl-cis,trans-isomerase involved in opening of the mitochondrial
      permeability transition pore (mPTP). CYPD abundance increases during aging
      in mammalian tissues and in the aging model organism Podospora anserina.
      Here we show that treatment of the P. anserina wild-type with low
      concentrations of the cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CSA) extends
      lifespan. Transgenic strains overexpressing PaCypD are characterized by
      reduced stress tolerance, suffer from pronounced mitochondrial
      dysfunction, and are characterized by accelerated aging and induction of
      cell death. Treatment with CSA leads to correction of mitochondrial
      function and lifespan to that of the wild-type. In contrast, PaCypD
      deletion strains are not affected by CSA within the investigated
      concentration range and show increased resistance against inducers of
      oxidative stress and cell death. Our data provide a mechanistic link
      between programmed cell death (PCD) and organismal aging, and bear
      implications for the potential use of CSA to intervene into biological
      aging.

      Persistent cognitive decline in older hospitalized patients in Taiwan.
      Journal of Advanced Nursing. Abstract Aim. This paper is a report of a
      study conducted to determine the prevalence and predictors of persistent
      and transient cognitive decline in older hospitalized patients over 6
      months after hospital discharge. Background. Cognitive decline occurs in
      16-35.5% of older hospitalized patients, but this decline may be
      persistent rather than transient. Distinguishing persistent from transient
      cognitive decline is clinically useful. Methods. For this prospective
      cohort study, 291 older patients were recruited from five medical and
      surgical units at a tertiary medical centre in Taiwan between 2004 and
      2006. Participants were assessed for cognitive status by scores on the
      Mini-Mental State Examination at admission, discharge, 3 and 6 months
      postdischarge. Persistent cognitive decline was defined as continuing
      score reduction and &gt;/=3-point reduction 6 months postdischarge. Transient
      decline was defined as &gt;/=3-point reduction at some stage, with a total
      decline &lt;3 points 6 months postdischarge. Findings. The cognitive status
      of the majority of participants (57.4%, n = 167) decreased &gt;/=3 points
      during follow-up. Of these decliners, 59 (35.3%) had persistent cognitive
      decline, with an average 5.32-point reduction 6 months postdischarge.
      Forty-six (27.5%) participants experienced transient cognitive decline.
      After multiple adjustments in logistic regression analysis, persistent
      decline was predicted by no in-hospital functional decline (OR = 0.16, P =
      0.002), more re-admissions after discharge (OR = 2.42, P = 0.020), and
      older age (OR = 1.09, P = 0.048). Conclusion. A new perspective is needed
      on discharge planning on patients at risk for persistent cognitive
      decline. Nurses can oversee the delivery of care, identify cognitive
      decline, refer patients, and educate families on strategies to enhance
      cognitive functioning for their aging relatives.

TI  - Falls among Koreans 45 years of age and older: incidence and risk factors.
AB  - hong g.-r.s., cho s.-h. &amp; tak y. (2010) Falls among Koreans 45 years of
      age and older: incidence and risk factors. Journal of Advanced Nursing.
      Abstract Aim. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of falls
      according to age and risk factors among Korean adults 45 years of age and
      older. Background. Falling is a known critical incident that results in
      injuries and limits the daily activities of older adults. Method. The 2006
      Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging, a publicly available database, was
      used for this study, which was conducted in 2006 with a total of 10,254
      respondents. The variables used in this study were selected from the
      demographic and health sections of the larger study. Findings. The overall
      incidence of any type of fall was 4.0%, and the incidence of injurious
      falls tended to increase with increasing age; however, people below 65
      years of age had a greater proportion of injurious falls than any of the
      older adult groups. All types of falls were more likely to occur among
      older adults and those with arthritis, visual deficits, cognitive
      impairments and depression. In addition, older age, visual deficits, weak
      grip, cognitive impairment and depression were key risk factors for falls
      requiring treatment and those resulting in difficulties in activities of
      daily living. Falls resulting in hip fractures occurred more frequently
      among women, people with visual deficits and those with depression.
      Conclusion. Future assessments of the incidence and risk factors for falls
      and studies of fall interventions should begin with younger age groups,
      namely those 45 years of age and older.

TI  - Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1): A Key Factor Linking
      Fibrinolysis and Age-Related Subclinical and Clinical Conditions.
AB  - SUMMARY Introduction: The close relationship existing between aging and
      thrombosis has growingly been studied in this last decade. The age-related
      development of a prothrombotic imbalance in the fibrinolysis homeostasis
      has been hypothesized as the basis of this increased cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular risk. Fibrinolysis is the result of the interactions among
      multiple plasminogen activators and inhibitors constituting the enzymatic
      cascade, and ultimately leading to the degradation of fibrin. The
      plasminogen activator system plays a key role in a wide range of
      physiological and pathological processes. Methods: Narrative review.
      Results: Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a member of the
      superfamily of serine-protease inhibitors (or serpins), and the principal
      inhibitor of both the tissue-type and the urokinase-type plasminogen
      activator, the two plasminogen activators able to activate plasminogen.
      Current evidence describing the central role played by PAI-1 in a number
      of age-related subclinical (i.e., inflammation, atherosclerosis, insulin
      resistance) and clinical (i.e., obesity, comorbidities, Werner syndrome)
      conditions is presented. Conclusions: Despite some controversial and
      unclear issues, PAI-1 represents an extremely promising marker that may
      become a biological parameter to be progressively considered in the
      prognostic evaluation, in the disease monitoring, and as treatment target
      of age-related conditions in the future.

TI  - Neuronal Calcium Homeostasis and Dysregulation.
AB  - The calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is the main second messenger that helps
      to transmit depolarization status and synaptic activity to the biochemical
      machinery of a neuron. These features make Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation a
      critical process in neurons, which have developed extensive and intricate
      Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathways. High intensity Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
      signaling necessitates high ATP consumption to restore basal (low)
      intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels after Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through
      plasma membrane receptor and voltage-dependent ion channels.
      Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx may also lead to increased generation of
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Impaired abilities of neurons
      to maintain cellular energy levels and to suppress ROS may impact
      Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling during aging and in neurodegenerative disease
      processes. This review focuses on mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum
      Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis and how they relate to synaptic
      Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling processes, neuronal energy metabolism and ROS
      generation. Also, the contribution of altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling to
      neurodegeneration during aging will be considered. Advances in
      understanding the molecular regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis and
      how it is perturbed in neurological disorders may lead to therapeutic
      strategies that modulate neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling to enhance
      function and counteract disease processes.

TI  - A Single-Dose Resveratrol Treatment in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic
      Lateral Sclerosis.
AB  - Abstract The underlying causes of denervation of the neuromuscular
      junction and eventual motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) have not been resolved. The superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)(G93A)
      mutant mouse is a frequently used animal model of ALS. We hypothesized
      that resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic molecule that enhances mammalian
      NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 deacetylases and may increase life span, would
      improve motor function and survival in the SOD1 mouse model via modulation
      of p53 acetylation. Data were collected for mean survival times,
      neuromuscular performance on the ROTOR-ROD (San Diego Instruments, San
      Diego, CA, USA), body weight, and p53 acetylation. Mean survival times
      were not statistically different (P = .23) between control and
      experimental (RSV-fed) groups (mean +/- SD, control [n = 11] 138 +/- 6
      days vs. experimental [n = 10] 135 +/- 8 days). Performance was not
      significantly different between groups at time points corresponding to
      50%, 80%, and 90% mean life span (P = .46), nor did RSV treatment
      attenuate body weight loss. Thus although manipulation of SIRT1
      deacetylase activity has effects at the protein level in healthy aging
      organisms, we conclude that RSV treatment does not lead to functional
      improvement or increased longevity in a mouse model of ALS. We speculate
      that RSV-mediated modulation of p53 acetylation is either incapable of
      increasing or insufficient to increase motor performance and longevity in
      this model of ALS.

TI  - Innovations in natural ingredients and their use in skin care.
PG  - S72-81; quiz s82-3
AB  - Natural ingredients have been used traditionally for millennia and their
      application in topical creams, lotions and preparations within the
      traditional medicines and healing traditions of many cultures has been
      observed. Over the last 20 years, clinical and laboratory studies have
      identified the benefits of an array of natural ingredients for skin care.
      Consequently, a number of these ingredients and compounds are today being
      developed, used or considered not only for anti-aging effects, but also
      for use in dermatologic disorders. Certain ingredients, such as colloidal
      oatmeal and aloe vera, have been identified as beneficial in the treatment
      of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, respectively, due to their
      anti-inflammatory properties. For combating acne and rosacea, green tea,
      niacinamide and feverfew are considered efficacious. As to
      hyperpigmentation and antioxidative capabilities, licorice, green tea,
      arbutin, soy, acai berry, turmeric and pomegranate are among those plants
      and compounds found to be most beneficial. Additional research is needed
      to determine to confirm and elucidate the benefits of these ingredients in
      the prevention and management of skin disease.

TI  - Acetyl-L-carnitine improves aged brain function.
PG  - S99-106
AB  - The effects of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), an acetyl derivative of
      L-carnitine, on memory and learning capacity and on brain synaptic
      functions of aged rats were examined. Male Fischer 344 rats were given
      ALCAR (100 mg/kg bodyweight) per os for 3 months and were subjected to the
      Hebb-Williams tasks and AKON-1 task to assess their learning capacity.
      Cholinergic activities were determined with synaptosomes isolated from
      brain cortices of the rats. Choline parameters, the high-affinity choline
      uptake, acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and depolarization-evoked ACh
      release were all enhanced in the ALCAR group. An increment of
      depolarization-induced calcium ion influx into synaptosomes was also
      evident in rats given ALCAR. Electrophysiological studies using
      hippocampus slices indicated that the excitatory postsynaptic potential
      slope and population spike size were both increased in ALCAR-treated rats.
      These results indicate that ALCAR increases synaptic neurotransmission in
      the brain and consequently improves learning capacity in aging rats.

TI  - Pathophysiological significance of senescence marker protein-30.
PG  - S88-98
AB  - A novel rat liver protein of 30 kDa, SMP30 decreases with aging. This
      protein is expressed most prominently in the liver and kidneys among the
      various organs. Its gene is located on the X chromosome. No functional
      domain was recognized in the entire amino acid sequence. Recently, we
      found a homology between rat SMP30 and two species of bacterial
      gluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.17). The lactonase reaction with
      L-gulono-gamma-lactone is the penultimate step in vitamin C (L-ascorbic
      acid) biosynthesis. SMP30-knockout (KO) mice fed a vitamin C-deficient
      diet displayed symptoms of scurvy. In SMP30-KO mice, hepatocytes were more
      susceptible to apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha plus actinomycin D than
      hepatocytes from wild-type mice. Two morphological features considered to
      be a hallmark of senescence are apparent in SMP30-KO mice. At 12 months of
      age, SMP30-knockout mice had clearly visible deposits of lipofuscin and
      senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-GAL) in their renal
      tubular epithelia. These features are compatible with high electron dense
      deposits in lysosomes. This observation suggests that the SMP30-knockout
      mouse is a useful model of ordinal senescence.

TI  - Klotho protein deficiency and aging.
PG  - S80-7
AB  - Aging is inevitable; however, the molecular mechanism of aging has not
      been fully elucidated. Investigations into aging are facing difficulties
      because aging is influenced by complex factors such as circumstances,
      living habits and genetic background. Recently, a variety of animals, such
      as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and mice, that have aberrations in
      their lifespan, have been investigated and a large number of genes related
      to aging have been found, one of which is alpha-klotho. The alpha-Klotho
      mouse (alpha-kl(-/-) mouse), which has a defect of the alpha-klotho gene
      expression, was established a decade ago. It is of great interest because
      the alpha-kl(-/-) mouse shows various phenotypes resembling human aging.
      The relationship between aging and alpha-klotho protein function is
      gradually becoming clear. This review covers the recent advance in
      alpha-klotho protein research.

PG  - S59-69
AB  - Lifespan can be lengthened by genetic and environmental modifications.
      Study of these might provide valuable insights into the mechanism of
      aging. Low doses of radiation and short-term exposure to heat and high
      concentrations of oxygen prolong the lifespan of the nematode
      Caenorhabditis elegans. These might be caused by adaptive responses to
      harmful environmental conditions. Single-gene mutations have been found to
      extend lifespan in C. elegans, Drosophila and mice. So far, the
      best-characterized system is the C. elegans mutant in the daf-2,
      insulin/IGF-I receptor gene that is the component of the insulin/IGF-I
      signaling pathway. The mutant animals live twice as long as the wild type.
      The insulin/IGF-I signaling pathway regulates the activity of DAF-16, a
      FOXO transcription factor. However, the unified explanation for the
      function of DAF-16 transcription targets in the lifespan extension is not
      yet fully established. As both of the Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)
      isoforms (sod-2 and sod-3) are found to be targets of DAF-16, we attempted
      to assess their functions in regulating lifespan and oxidative stress
      responsivity. We show that the double deletions of sod-2 and sod-3 genes
      induced oxidative-stress sensitivity but do not shorten lifespan in the
      daf-2 mutant background, indicating that oxidative stress is not
      necessarily a limiting factor for longevity. Furthermore, the deletion in
      the sod-3 gene lengthens lifespan in the daf-2 mutant. We conclude that
      the MnSOD systems in C. elegans fine-tune the insulin/IGF-I-signaling
      based regulation of longevity by acting not as anti-oxidants but as
      physiological-redox-signaling modulators.

TI  - Importance of research on peptidylarginine deiminase and citrullinated
      proteins in age-related disease.
PG  - S53-8
AB  - Peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD) are a group of post-translational
      modification enzymes that citrullinate (deiminate) protein arginine
      residues in a calcium ion-dependent manner. Enzymatic citrullination
      abolishes positive charges of native protein molecules, inevitably causing
      significant alterations in their structure and functions. Citrullinated
      protein has an important physiological purpose; the formation of a
      cornified layer of skin that covers the human body. Despite this
      beneficial function, citrullinated protein also has a negative side,
      because this protein's accumulation in the brain is a possible cause of
      Alzheimer's disease. In the present review, we introduce PAD and their
      protein citrullination function, now considered critical for advancing
      research on aging and disease.

PG  - S41-52
AB  - The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells participates in signal
      transduction and many other cellular events to maintain the physiological
      state of cells. In recent decades, much attention has been paid to
      membrane microdomains, called lipid rafts or membrane rafts, as signaling
      platforms in the plasma membrane. Lipid rafts are lateral lipid clusters
      enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids in which particular molecules
      are concentrated and participate in membrane-mediated signaling events.
      Recent studies have shown a close relationship between lipid rafts and the
      age-associated decline and dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways,
      such as T-cell receptor signaling and cellular senescence-related
      signaling. Lipid rafts have also been implicated in senile diseases and in
      lifestyle-related diseases whose incidences increase with age.

PG  - S32-40
AB  - Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification of
      proteins. Protein sequence data suggested that more than half of all
      proteins produced in mammalian cells are glycoproteins. Recent studies
      showed that glycans of secreted glycoproteins affect many protein
      properties, such as solubility, stability, protease sensitivity and
      polarity, whereas glycans on cell-surface glycoproteins are involved in
      various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication.
      Accordingly, the investigation of glycoprotein changes caused by aging is
      expected to help understand the aging process and to elucidate
      age-associated diseases. The present review will summarize our current
      knowledge of changes found in brain glycoproteins resulting from the aging
      process.

TI  - Proteomic approaches to oxidative protein modifications implicated in the
      mechanism of aging.
PG  - S25-31
AB  - Accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins is widely observed in aged
      animal tissues. Protein carbonyls are mostly derived from lysine,
      arginine, proline and threonine residues under oxidative conditions. Many
      groups have investigated carbonylated proteins since a convenient
      immunochemical procedure was established for detecting dinitrophenyl
      derivatives of carbonyls and applied to proteomic research. An alternative
      method of tagging with biotin or fluorescent dyes has been also introduced
      to proteomic analysis of protein carbonyls. Nitrotyrosine was primarily
      identified as a biomarker of cellular damage and inflammation under
      nitrosative stress. Nitrated proteins have been subsequently detected in
      aged animal tissues and Alzheimer's disease affected brains by Western
      blotting, and identified by mass spectrometry. Protein s-thiolation, a
      mixed-derivatization of cysteine (Cys) by conjugation of
      low-molecular-weight thiol compounds, is recognized as protecting
      functional proteins from more serious damage. A method of biotin labeling
      has been used in proteomics for tracing protein s-thiolation. Among all
      kinds of amino acid residues, methionine (Met) is the most susceptible to
      reactive oxygen species, and Met oxidation seems to occur in ordinary
      cellular circumstances because most cells contain Met sulfoxide
      reductases, which might prevent serious cellular damage. In proteomic
      analysis, Met sulfoxide-containing peptides are generally observed as
      16-Da-high mass peaks in peptide mass fingerprinting. A modified procedure
      of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in which proteins are kept under
      non-oxidative conditions throughout the procedure, is appropriate for the
      estimation of the Met sulfoxide level of each protein in aged animal
      tissues and cells to evaluate the pathophysiological significance of Met
      oxidation in the mechanism of aging.

PG  - S213-20
AB  - The large and medium-sized arteries in elderly people show varying degrees
      of intimal and medial change. The medial change is known as age-related
      medial degeneration and sclerosis (ARMDS). The ARMDS results in systolic
      hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy of the heart as a result of
      loss of arterial elasticity. It also causes aortic dilatation, or even
      aortic aneurysm. The ARMDS and atherosclerosis are distinct entities, but
      are often overlapped and confused with each other. The present review
      mainly focuses on ARMDS and briefly addresses atherosclerosis, and aging
      of arterioles, capillaries and veins. The smooth muscle cells in the inner
      half of the aortic media of elderly people degenerate and undergo
      apoptosis. This causes degradation of elastin fibers and the accumulation
      of collagen fibers in the media, but the inflammatory infiltrates are
      scarce. Biochemical studies showed an age-related decrease of elastin and
      its crosslinks, and an increase of collagen and its crosslink. Because the
      turnover of elastin is very long, it likely suffers from glycation
      (Maillard reaction) and glyco-oxidative reaction. The advanced glycation
      end-products accumulate in the aortic media with increasing age.
      Alcian-blue positive mucin accumulates in aortic media in elderly people.
      The major component of the increase of aortic mucin is
      chondroitin-6-sulfate. Microcalcification is frequent in the inner
      acellular portion of the aortic media in elderly people. Calcium contents
      increase with age. In conclusion, the ARMDS is a distinct pathological
      entity with clinical significance. The pathogenesis of ARMDS is unclear;
      the mechanical stress of elastin, endothelial dysfunction, and glycation
      of elastin are proposed.

TI  - Role of methylation of the hMLH1 gene promoter in the development of
      gastric and colorectal carcinoma in the elderly.
PG  - S207-12
AB  - The occurrence of malignant neoplasms increases with advancing age.
      Although aging and carcinogenesis are basically different processes, they
      share phenomena such as the accumulation of DNA damage and abnormal
      proteins. Recent advances in molecular biology have shown an accumulation
      of genetic and epigenetic changes in both aging and carcinogenesis, as
      well as the alteration of metabolism, immunosenescence and shortened
      telomeres. DNA methylation is a representative epigenetic phenomenon and
      is frequently involved in controlling gene functions during development
      and tumorigenesis. We herein focused on methylation of genes in the
      development of gastrointestinal carcinomas in the elderly. The proportion
      of gastric and colorectal carcinomas with hypermethylation of the hMLH1
      promoter increases with age, reaching 25-30% of all carcinomas of the
      stomach and large intestine in elderly patients. These tumors have
      clinicopathological and molecular characteristics such as loss of hMLH1
      expression, microsatellite instability, poorly differentiated histology,
      peritumoral inflammatory cell infiltration, low incidence of lymph node
      metastasis and favorable prognosis. However, methylation-related
      carcinogenesis accounts for up to approximately one-third of tumors, and
      other mechanisms; for example chromosomal instability as a result of
      telomere dysfunction, are responsible for the development of most
      carcinomas in the elderly.

TI  - Changes of telomere length with aging.
PG  - S197-206
AB  - We reviewed our methodology and results of telomere measurements, with
      reference to telomere length and aging. Human tissues always showed
      telomere shortening with age, except for the brain and myocardium. Yearly
      rates of telomere length reduction in various tissues were mostly within
      the range 20-60 bp, and thus compatible with that expected from only one
      round of mitosis. It was suggested that when telomeres were found to be
      longer in any specific organ in a given individual, then the other organs
      in that individual would also have longer telomeres. Using the
      quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) method for
      telomere measurement, we were able to measure the telomere lengths of
      various cell types within tissues. Here we summarize the results obtained
      for various cell types in the stomach, tongue and breast. Our Q-FISH
      method using our original software program "Tissue Telo" is excellent for
      measuring telomere lengths using tissue sections and PNA probes.

TI  - Muscle weakness and neuromuscular junctions in aging and disease.
PG  - S137-47
AB  - A critical issue in today's super-aging society is the need to reduce the
      burden of family care while continuing to make our medical institutions
      supportive. A rapidly emerging, major health concern is the debilitating
      effect of muscle weakness and atrophy from aging, termed sarcopenia;
      however, the molecular basis of this condition is not well understood. Our
      research aim is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of age-related
      muscle atrophy and to devise new measures for preventing and treating this
      disability. A promising treatment for muscle atrophy is the promotion of
      muscle regeneration by recruiting stem cells into the targeted region. The
      first requirement is to understand how the motor system, which consists of
      muscles and motoneurons, is maintained to accomplish that goal. Recent
      studies in the field of neuroscience have focused on neuromuscular
      junctions (NMJ), which play important roles in the maintenance of both
      motor nerves and muscle fibers. Signaling between muscles and motoneurons
      at NMJ supports interactions within the motor system. To understand the
      mechanisms involved, we focus our research on the pathogenic processes
      underlying neuromuscular diseases. The well-known autoimmune disease,
      myasthenia gravis (MG), serves as a model not only for tracking the
      pathogenesis and treatment outcomes of all autoimmune diseases, but also
      for understanding synaptic functions in maintaining the motor system.
      Here, we describe recent insights into the molecular mechanisms required
      for the maintenance of NMJ and the related causes of muscle atrophy.

AB  - There are significant age-related changes in autonomic nervous system
      function that are responsible for an impaired ability to adapt to
      environmental or intrinsic visceral stimuli in the elderly. We review data
      on changes in autonomic nervous system regulation of cardiovascular and
      urinary function, as well as data on strategies to improve function. There
      are data showing alterations in peripheral and central autonomic nerve
      activity, and decreases in neurotransmitter receptor action that lead to
      diminished autonomic reactivity (e.g. blood pressure and cerebral blood
      flow regulation) and poorly coordinated autonomic discharge (e.g. bladder
      function). Simple strategies for autonomic function improvement and
      increasing cortical blood flow include walking and somatic afferent
      stimulation (e.g. stroking skin or acupuncture) to increase sympathetic,
      parasympathetic and central cholinergic activity.

TI  - Association of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene polymorphism with pancreatic
      cancer but not colon cancer.
PG  - S120-6
AB  - AIMS: Most of the acetaldehyde, a recognized animal carcinogen, generated
      during alcohol metabolism is eliminated by liver mitochondrial aldehyde
      dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). More than 40% of Japanese people have the
      inactive form of ALDH2, and inactive ALDH2 is a risk factor for multiple
      cancer of the esophagus, as well as head and neck cancer. Possible
      associations between pancreatic cancer and ALDH2 gene polymorphism, as
      well as between colon cancer and ALDH2 gene polymorphism, in conjunction
      with smoking and/or drinking habits, were examined in a Japanese
      population. METHODS: Patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 187) and with
      colon cancer (n = 49) were examined. The drinking (5 g ethanol
      consumption/day) and/or smoking habits as well as ALDH2 gene polymorphism
      were examined. The age-matched control subjects were recruited in the NILS
      Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSA). RESULTS: Aging, smoking and inactive
      ALDH2, but not alcohol, are independent risk factors for pancreatic
      cancer. The frequency of smoking habits tended to be higher in patients
      with colon cancer compared with the patients without cancer. However, age,
      body mass index or the distribution of ALDH2 genotypes did not differ
      significantly among the patients with colon cancer, colon polyps and
      others. CONCLUSIONS: Inactive ALDH2 is an independent risk factor for
      pancreatic cancer, but inactive ALDH2 might not be a risk for colon
      cancer.

TI  - Age-associated changes of appetite-regulating peptides.
PG  - S107-19
AB  - Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in appetite and food
      intake. The reasons for the decline in food intake are multifactorial, and
      relate to both peripheral and central mechanisms. Current studies about
      the regulation of food intake suggest that there are many central
      mediators that control the appetite. To determine the mechanism of
      age-associated decrease in appetite and food intake, we focused on the
      age-associated changes of the suppressing and stimulatory effect of some
      appetite-regulating peptides. At first, we examined cholecystokinin (CCK),
      one of the typical appetite-suppressing factors. Although sensitivity to
      CCK is enhanced in old animals, the mechanism underlying this effect has
      not been elucidated. Next, we focused on the appetite-stimulating
      peptides, orexin-A, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ghrelin, which are known to
      play a critical role in food intake. To determine the age-associated
      decrease in appetite and food intake, we compared the stimulatory effect
      of intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A, NPY and ghrelin. We
      report the studies of the age-associated changes of appetite-regulating
      peptides in this review.

TI  - Age-related increase of reactive oxygen generation in the brains of
      mammals and birds: is reactive oxygen a signaling molecule to determine
      the aging process and life span?
PG  - S10-24
AB  - Since Harman proposed the "free-radical theory of aging", oxidative stress
      has been postulated to be a major causal factor of senescence. The
      accumulation of oxidative stress-induced oxidatively modified
      macromolecules, including protein, DNA and lipid, were found in tissues
      during the aging process; however, it is not necessarily clear which
      factor is more critical, an increase in endogenous reactive oxygen and/or
      a decrease in anti-oxidative defense, to the age-related increase in
      oxidative damage. To clarify the increasing production of reactive oxygen
      with age, we examined reactive oxygen-dependent chemiluminescent (CL)
      signals in ex vivo brain slices prepared from different-aged animal brains
      during hypoxia-reoxygenation treatment using a novel photonic imaging
      method. The CL signal was intensified during reoxygenation. The signals in
      SAMP10 (short-life strain) and SAMR1 (control) brain slices increased with
      aging. The slope of the increase of CL intensity with age in P10 was
      steeper than in R1. Age-dependent increase of CL intensity was also
      observed in C57BL/6 mice, Wistar rats and pigeons; however, superoxide
      dismutase (SOD) activity in the brain did not change with age. These
      results suggest that reactive oxygen production itself increased with
      aging. The rate of age-related increases of CL intensity was inversely
      related to the maximum lifespan of animals. We speculate that reactive
      oxygen might be a signaling molecule and its levels in tissue might
      determine the aging process and lifespan. Decelerating age-related
      increases of reactive oxygen production are expected to be a potent
      strategy for anti-aging interventions.

TI  - Survival responses to oxidative stress and aging.
PG  - S1-9
AB  - Oxidative stress is recognized as an important environmental factor in
      aging; however, because reactive oxygen species (ROS) and related free
      radicals are normally produced both intra- and extracellularly, air-living
      organisms cannot avoid the risk of oxidative stress. Consequently, these
      organisms have evolved various anti-oxidant systems to prevent ROS,
      scavenge free radicals, repair damaged components and adaptive responses.
      This review will focus on the repair and adaptive response to oxidative
      stress, and summarize the changes of these systems as a result aging and
      their relationship to premature aging.

TI  - Prophylactic dietary restriction may promote functional recovery and
      increase lifespan after spinal cord injury.
PG  - E1-11
AB  - Functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is limited, and the
      injury results in a dramatic reduction in long-term lifespan. Prophylactic
      dietary restriction (DR) robustly extends animal lifespan, and is
      beneficial in models of neuronal insult. In rats, we found that one form
      of DR, every-other-day-fasting (EODF), which started 1 month prior to a
      cervical SCI improved functional recovery, resulted in greater numbers of
      neurons surrounding the injury site, and a approximately 45% reduction in
      lesion size compared to the control group. In the light of the low-risk
      implementation of prophylactic EODF, the clinical translation as a
      treatment prior to elective subacute or chronic interventions is
      attractive. There are numerous secondary complications after human SCI,
      including a 13- to 25-year reduction in lifespan. DR consistently
      increases median and maximal lifespan in a large range of organisms,
      including non-human primates. Animal research suggests that EODF might
      reduce many of the secondary complications people with SCI suffer from.
      Dietary interventions may provide the possibility to improve the quality
      and span of life for individuals with SCI.

TI  - Somatic polyploidy promotes cell function under stress and energy
      depletion: evidence from tissue-specific mammal transcriptome.
AB  - Polyploid cells show great among-species and among-tissues diversity and
      relation to developmental mode, suggesting their importance in adaptive
      evolution and developmental programming. At the same time, excessive
      polyploidization is a hallmark of functional impairment, aging, growth
      disorders, and numerous pathologies including cancer and cardiac diseases.
      To shed light on this paradox and to find out how polyploidy contributes
      to organ functions, we review here the ploidy-associated shifts in
      activity of narrowly expressed (tissue specific) genes in human and mouse
      heart and liver, which have the reciprocal pattern of polyploidization.
      For this purpose, we use the modular biology approach and genome-scale
      cross-species comparison. It is evident from this review that heart and
      liver show similar traits in response to polyploidization. In both organs,
      polyploidy protects vitality (mainly due to the activation of
      sirtuin-mediated pathways), triggers the reserve adenosine-5'-triphosphate
      (ATP) production, and sustains tissue-specific functions by switching them
      to energy saving mode. In heart, the strongest effects consisted in the
      concerted up-regulation of contractile proteins and substitution of energy
      intensive proteins with energy economic ones. As a striking example, the
      energy intensive alpha myosin heavy chain (providing fast contraction)
      decreased its expression by a factor of 10, allowing a 270-fold increase
      of expression of beta myosin heavy chain (providing slow contraction),
      which has approximately threefold lower ATP-hydrolyzing activity. The
      liver showed the enhancement of immunity, reactive oxygen species and
      xenobiotic detoxication, and numerous metabolic adaptations to long-term
      energy depletion. Thus, somatic polyploidy may be an ingenious
      evolutionary instrument for fast adaptation to stress and new environments
      allowing trade-offs between high functional demand, stress, and energy
      depletion.

TI  - Differential involvement of hippocampal serotonin(1A) receptors and
      re-uptake sites in non-cognitive behaviors of Alzheimer's disease.
AB  - RATIONALE: Previous studies have shown extensive serotonergic deficits in
      the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, it is
      unclear whether such deficits play a role in non-cognitive,
      neuropsychiatric behaviors that occur frequently in AD and cause
      significant caregiver distress. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to
      correlate serotonergic markers in the AD hippocampus with neuropsychiatric
      behaviors. METHODS: Using postmortem hippocampal homogenates from aged
      controls as well as a cohort of longitudinally assessed AD patients,
      measurements of 5-HT(1A) receptors, 5-HT(2A) receptors, and serotonin
      re-uptake (5-HTT) sites were performed by binding with (3)H-labeled
      8-OH-DPAT, ketanserin, and citalopram, respectively. RESULTS: Alterations
      of 5-HT(1A) receptors and 5-HTT were found to be differentially involved
      in neuropsychiatric behaviors, with loss of 5-HT(1A) receptors
      specifically correlated with depressive symptoms, while 5-HTT sites were
      preserved or up-regulated in patients with aggressive behaviors.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that neuropsychiatric behaviors in AD share
      certain neurochemical features with psychiatric disorders like major
      depression and that serotonergic drugs used in psychiatric disorders may
      also be efficacious against behavioral symptoms in AD.

TI  - Successful Aging through the Eyes of Alaska Natives: Exploring
      Generational Differences Among Alaska Natives.
AB  - There is very little research on Alaska Native (AN) elders and how they
      subjectively define a successful older age. The lack of a
      culturally-specific definition often results in the use of a generic
      definition that portrays Alaska Native elders as aging less successfully
      than their White counterparts. However, there is a very limited
      understanding of a diverse array of successful aging experiences across
      generations. This research explores the concept of successful aging from
      an Alaska Native perspective, or what it means to age well in Alaska
      Native communities. An adapted Explanatory Model (EM) approach was used to
      gain a sense of the beliefs about aging from Alaska Natives. Research
      findings indicate that aging successfully is based on local understandings
      about personal responsibility and making the conscious decision to live a
      clean and healthy life, abstaining from drugs and alcohol. The findings
      also indicate that poor aging is often characterized by a lack of personal
      responsibility, or not being active, not being able to handle alcohol, and
      giving up on oneself. Most participants stated that elder status is not
      determined by reaching a certain age (e.g., 65), but instead is designated
      when an individual has demonstrated wisdom because of the experiences he
      or she has gained throughout life. This research seeks to inform future
      studies on rural aging that prioritizes the perspectives of elders to
      impact positively on the delivery of health care services and programs in
      rural Alaska.

      in multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy.
PG  - 1388-93
AB  - Familial aggregation has been consistently found in PD, but it is unclear
      whether there is a familial aggregation in families of patients with
      multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). MSA
      and PSP cases were recruited from a two-arm case control study. One
      control was matched to each case for age, gender and living area. Medical
      history of first-degree relatives was obtained through a face-to-face
      questionnaire. Age-specific cumulative incidence of Parkinsonism and
      dementia in first-degree relatives of cases and controls was compared for
      MSA and PSP separately. Seventy-one pairs for MSA and their controls and
      79 pairs for PSP and their controls were included. No significant familial
      aggregation was found in PSP. MSA cases reported Parkinsonism more often,
      but not dementia in their first-degree relatives than controls. MSA
      patients, but not those with PSP, have Parkinsonism more often in their
      first-degree relatives than controls.

TI  - Correlation between degree of white matter hyperintensities and global
      gray matter volume decline rate.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Whether the degree of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs)
      shows a significant correlation with the rate of global gray matter volume
      decline over a period following initial baseline measurement remains
      unclear. The purpose of the present study was to reveal the relationship
      between the degree of WMHs at baseline and the rate of global gray matter
      volume decline by applying a longitudinal design. METHODS: Using a 6-year
      longitudinal design and magnetic resonance images of the brains of 160
      healthy individuals aged over 50 years and living in the community, we
      analyzed the correlation between degree of WMHs using Fazekas scaling at
      baseline and rate of global gray matter volume decline 6 years later. To
      obtain the rate of global gray matter volume decline, we calculated global
      gray matter volume and intracranial volume at baseline and at follow-up
      using a fully automated method. RESULTS: The annual percentage change in
      the gray matter ratio (GMR, APC(GMR)), in which GMR represents the
      percentage of gray matter volume in the intracranial volume, showed a
      significant positive correlation with the degree of deep WMHs and
      periventricular WMHs at baseline, after adjusting for age, gender, present
      history of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Our results
      suggest that degree of WMHs at baseline predicts the rate of gray matter
      volume decline 6 years later and that simple visual scaling of WMHs could
      contribute to predicting the rate of global gray matter volume decline.

TI  - Inhibition of the progesterone nuclear receptor during the bone linear
      growth phase increases peak bone mass in female mice.
PG  - e11410
AB  - Augmentation of the peak bone mass (PBM) may be one of the most effective
      interventions to reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis later in life;
      however treatments to augment PBM are currently limited. Our study
      evaluated whether a greater PBM could be achieved either in the
      progesterone nuclear receptor knockout mice (PRKO) or by using a nuclear
      progesterone receptor (nPR) antagonist, RU486 in mice. Compared to their
      wild type (WT) littermates the female PRKO mice developed significantly
      higher cancellous and cortical mass in the distal femurs, and this was
      associated with increased bone formation. The high bone mass phenotype was
      partially reproduced by administering RU486 in female WT mice from 1-3
      months of age. Our results suggest that the inhibition of the nPR during
      the rapid bone growth period (1-3 months) increases osteogenesis, which
      results in acquisition of higher bone mass. Our findings suggest a crucial
      role for progesterone signaling in bone acquisition and inhibition of the
      nPR as a novel approach to augment bone mass, which may have the potential
      to reduce the burden of osteoporosis.

TI  - Longitudinal Medication Usage in Alzheimer Disease Patients.
AB  - This study examined in detail patterns of cholinesterase inhibitors
      (ChEIs) and memantine use and explored the relationship between patient
      characteristics and such use. Patients with probable Alzheimer disease AD
      (n=201) were recruited from the Predictors Study in 3 academic AD centers
      and followed from early disease stages for up to 6 years. Random effects
      logistic regressions were used to examine effects of patient
      characteristics on ChEIs/memantine use over time. Independent variables
      included measures of function, cognition, comorbidities, the presence of
      extrapyramidal signs, psychotic symptoms, age, sex, and patient's living
      situation at each interval. Control variables included assessment
      interval, year of study entry, and site. During a 6-year study period,
      rate of ChEIs use decreased (80.6% to 73.0%) whereas memantine use
      increased (2.0% to 45.9%). Random effects logistic regression analyses
      showed that ChEI use was associated with better function, no psychotic
      symptoms, and younger age. Memantine use was associated with better
      function, poorer cognition, living at home, later assessment interval, and
      later year of study entry. Results suggest that high rate of ChEI use and
      increasing memantine use over time are consistent with current practice
      guidelines of initiation of ChEIs in mild-to-moderate AD patients and
      initiation of memantine in moderate-to-severe patients.

TI  - Kinetic analysis of the rate of corneal wound healing in Otsuka long-evans
      Tokushima Fatty rats, a model of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 441-9
AB  - Diabetic keratopathy is a well-known ocular complication secondary to type
      2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we performed a kinetic analysis of
      corneal wound healing in Long-Evans rats (normal rat) and Otsuka
      Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Corneal wound healing in 7-week-old normal rats was mostly
      complete 24 h after corneal epithelial abrasion, and the process of
      corneal wound healing took place according to an equation with a
      first-order rate constant. The rate of corneal wound healing in normal
      rats decreased with aging. The process of corneal wound healing in 38- and
      60-week-old normal and OLETF rats occurred in two phases with rate
      constants for the first and second phases represented as alpha and beta,
      respectively. The alpha and beta values in 38- and 60-week-old OLETF rats
      were lower than those in normal rats of the corresponding age.
      Furthermore, a close relationship was observed between the corneal wound
      healing rate constant and plasma glucose levels in OLETF rats. The present
      studies suggest the sequence of events that occur following damage to the
      corneal surface in OLETF rats as a model animal for a human type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Circadian Variation in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests due to Cardiac
      Cause in a Japanese Patient Population.
AB  - Background: It has been reported that cardiovascular events occur more
      frequently in the morning than in the evening. The purpose of the present
      study was to assess the characteristics of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests
      due to cardiac cause in a 24-h period in Japanese patients. Methods and
      Results: Of 2,199 consecutive patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      outside hospital, 1,293 cardiogenic patients were enrolled. The incidence
      of cardiac arrests was assessed as hourly data (ie, circadian variation),
      and investigated for differences in age, gender, and the location at
      onset. Cardiac arrests had an apparent circadian rhythm that was
      characterized by 2 long zeniths in the morning and evening. The peak was
      at 17:00-18:00 hours. Younger patients had more cardiac arrests in the
      morning than in the evening. In contrast, older patients had more events
      in the evening than in the morning. The circadian rhythm did not differ in
      gender. Regarding location, the patient's residence was the most common
      place for cardiac arrest. In the residence, the bathroom was associated
      with the evening zenith of circadian variation. Conclusions:
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests due to cardiac cause in Japanese patients
      have an apparent circadian variation with 2 long zeniths, with an evening
      predominance in older patients. Aging affects the evening zenith, in that
      elderly patients &gt;/=80 years old have a zenith associated with bath time
      in the evening.

TI  - White matter changes and diabetes predict cognitive decline in the
      elderly: the LADIS study.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study if age-related white matter changes (WMC) and
      vascular risk factors were predictors of cognitive decline in elderly
      subjects with WMC living independently. METHODS: The Leukoaraiosis and
      Disability prospective multinational European study (LADIS) evaluates the
      impact of WMC on the transition of independent elderly subjects into
      disability. Independent elderly were enrolled due to the presence of WMC.
      Subjects were evaluated yearly during 3 years with a comprehensive
      clinical protocol and a neuropsychological battery. Additionally,
      dementia, subtypes of dementia, and cognitive decline without dementia
      were classified according to usual clinical criteria. MRI was performed at
      entry and at the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 639 subjects were
      included (74.1 +/- 5 years, 55% women, 9.6 +/- 3.8 years of schooling). At
      end of follow-up, 90 patients had dementia and 147 had cognitive
      impairment no dementia. Using Cox regression analysis, WMC severity
      independently predicted cognitive decline (dementia and not dementia),
      independently of age, education, and medial temporal atrophy (MTA).
      Diabetes at baseline was the only vascular risk factor that independently
      predicted cognitive decline during follow-up, controlling for age,
      education, WMC severity, and temporal atrophy. Considering subtypes of
      dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD) was predicted only by MTA, while vascular
      dementia was predicted by previous stroke, WMC severity, and MTA.
      CONCLUSION: WMC severity and diabetes are independent predictors of
      cognitive decline in an initially nondisabled elderly population. Vascular
      dementia is predicted by previous stroke and WMC, while AD is predicted
      only by MTA.

TI  - Serial MRI and CSF biomarkers in normal aging, MCI, and AD.
PG  - 143-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the annual change in MRI and CSF biomarkers in
      cognitively normal (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and
      Alzheimer disease (AD). Comparisons were based on intergroup
      discrimination, correlation with concurrent cognitive/functional changes,
      relationships to APOE genotype, and sample sizes for clinical trials.
      METHODS: We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      study consisting of CN, aMCI, and AD cohorts with both baseline and
      12-month follow-up CSF and MRI. The annual change in CSF (total-tau
      [t-tau], Abeta(1-42)) and MRI (change in ventricular volume) was obtained
      in 312 subjects (92 CN, 149 aMCI, 71 AD). RESULTS: There was no
      significant average annual change in either CSF biomarker in any clinical
      group except t-tau in CN; moreover, the annual change did not differ by
      clinical group in pairwise comparisons. In contrast, annual increase in
      ventricular volume increased in the following order, AD &gt; aMCI &gt; CN, and
      differences were significant between all clinical groups in pairwise
      comparisons. Ventricular volume increase correlated with concurrent
      worsening on cognitive/functional indices in aMCI and AD whereas evidence
      of a similar correlation with change in CSF measures was unclear. The
      annual changes in MRI differed by APOE epsilon4 status overall and among
      aMCI while annual changes in CSF biomarkers did not. Estimated sample
      sizes for clinical trials are notably less for MRI than the CSF or
      clinical measures. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the CSF biomarkers evaluated,
      changes in serial structural MRI are correlated with concurrent change on
      general cognitive and functional indices in impaired subjects, track with
      clinical disease stage, and are influenced by APOE genotype.

TI  - Aging-Related Early Changes in Markers of Ventricular and Matrix
      Remodeling After Reperfused ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in
      the Canine Model: Effect of Early Therapy With an Angiotensin II Type 1
      Receptor Blocker.
PG  - 341-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with reperfused ST-segment-elevation
      myocardial infarction are at increased risk for left ventricular
      remodeling. Extracellular matrix damage has been implicated in early
      remodeling. We hypothesized that aging results in enhanced early
      reperfusion injury and left ventricular remodeling after reperfused
      ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and that early therapy
      initiated at the time of reperfusion with an angiotensin II type 1
      receptor blocker such as candesartan attenuates age-related increases in
      reperfusion injury and remodeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 3
      groups of dogs (age, 1 to 2, 2.1 to 5, and 5.1 to 10 years) with
      reperfused ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (90 minutes of
      ischemia, 2 hours of reperfusion) to therapy with placebo or candesartan
      (1 mg/kg CV-11974) over 30 minutes from the onset of reperfusion.
      Reperfusion in placebo groups was associated with aging-related changes in
      the ischemic zones in markers of damage (increased ischemic injury,
      infarct size [as percent risk], cardiomyocyte apoptosis, blood flow
      impairment, no reflow), structural remodeling (increased left ventricular
      dilation and dysfunction), extracellular matrix remodeling (increased
      expression of secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor, secreted protein
      acidic and rich in cysteine, osteopontin, a disintegrin and
      metalloproteinase-10 and -17, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2), and
      inflammation (increased inducible nitric oxide synthase, proinflammatory
      cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming
      growth factor-beta(1); decreased antiinflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-10). Compared with placebo, candesartan attenuated these
      age-dependent changes. CONCLUSIONS: Aging results in age-dependent early
      increases in markers of damage and adverse structural and matrix
      remodeling after ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction reperfused
      after 90 minutes of ischemia, and early therapy initiated at the time of
      reperfusion with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker candesartan
      attenuates these changes. This strategy needs clinical confirmation.

TI  - Telephone assessment of cognitive function in the late-onset Alzheimer's
      disease family study.
PG  - 855-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Administration of cognitive test batteries by telephone has
      been shown to be a valid and cost-effective means of assessing cognition,
      but it remains relatively uncommon in epidemiological research.
      OBJECTIVES: To develop composite cognitive measures and assess how much of
      the variability in their scores is associated with mode of test
      administration (ie, in person or by telephone). DESIGN: Cross-sectional
      cohort study. SETTING: Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study
      conducted at 18 centers across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of
      1584 persons, 368 with dementia, from 646 families. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Scores on composite measures of memory and cognitive function derived from
      a battery of 7 performance tests administered in person (69%) or by
      telephone (31%) by examiners who underwent a structured performance-based
      training program with annual recertification. RESULTS: Based in part on
      the results of a factor analysis of the 7 tests, we developed summary
      measures of working memory, declarative memory, episodic memory, semantic
      memory, and global cognition. In linear regression analyses, mode of test
      administration accounted for less than 2% of the variance in the measures.
      In mixed-effects models, variability in cognitive scores due to center was
      small relative to variability due to differences between individuals and
      families. CONCLUSIONS: In epidemiologic research on aging and Alzheimer
      disease, assessment of cognition by telephone has little effect on
      performance and provides operational flexibility and a means of reducing
      both costs and missing data.

TI  - Aging and nonergodicity beyond the Khinchin theorem.
PG  - 13228-33
AB  - The Khinchin theorem provides the condition that a stationary process is
      ergodic, in terms of the behavior of the corresponding correlation
      function. Many physical systems are governed by nonstationary processes in
      which correlation functions exhibit aging. We classify the ergodic
      behavior of such systems and suggest a possible generalization of
      Khinchin's theorem. Our work also quantifies deviations from ergodicity in
      terms of aging correlation functions. Using the framework of the
      fractional Fokker-Planck equation, we obtain a simple analytical
      expression for the two-time correlation function of the particle
      displacement in a general binding potential, revealing universality in the
      sense that the binding potential only enters into the prefactor through
      the first two moments of the corresponding Boltzmann distribution. We
      discuss applications to experimental data from systems exhibiting
      anomalous dynamics.

TI  - Mammalian life-span determinant p66shcA mediates obesity-induced insulin
      resistance.
PG  - 13420-5
AB  - Obesity and metabolic syndrome result from excess calorie intake and
      genetic predisposition and are mechanistically linked to type II diabetes
      and accelerated body aging; abnormal nutrient and insulin signaling
      participate in this pathologic process, yet the underlying molecular
      mechanisms are incompletely understood. Mice lacking the p66 kDa isoform
      of the Shc adaptor molecule live longer and are leaner than wild-type
      animals, suggesting that this molecule may have a role in metabolic
      derangement and premature senescence by overnutrition. We found that p66
      deficiency exerts a modest but significant protective effect on fat
      accumulation and premature death in lep(Ob/Ob) mice, an established
      genetic model of obesity and insulin resistance; strikingly, however, p66
      inactivation improved glucose tolerance in these animals, without
      affecting (hyper)insulinaemia and independent of body weight. Protection
      from insulin resistance was cell autonomous, because isolated p66KO
      preadipocytes were relatively resistant to insulin desensitization by free
      fatty acids in vitro. Biochemical studies revealed that p66shc promotes
      the signal-inhibitory phosphorylation of the major insulin transducer
      IRS-1, by bridging IRS-1 and the mTOR effector p70S6 kinase, a molecule
      previously linked to obesity-induced insulin resistance. Importantly,
      IRS-1 was strongly up-regulated in the adipose tissue of p66KO lep(Ob/Ob)
      mice, confirming that effects of p66 on tissue responsiveness to insulin
      are largely mediated by this molecule. Taken together, these findings
      identify p66shc as a major mediator of insulin resistance by excess
      nutrients, and by extension, as a potential molecular target against the
      spreading epidemic of obesity and type II diabetes.

TI  - Antibody-directed myostatin inhibition in 21-mo-old mice reveals novel
      roles for myostatin signaling in skeletal muscle structure and function.
AB  - Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function
      with advancing age, leading to reduced mobility and quality of life. We
      tested the hypothesis that antibody-directed myostatin inhibition would
      attenuate the decline in mass and function of muscles of aged mice and
      that apoptosis would be reduced. Eighteen-month-old C57BL/6 mice were
      treated for 14 wk with a once-weekly injection of saline (control, n=9) or
      a mouse chimera of anti-human myostatin antibody (PF-354, 10 mg/kg; n=12).
      PF-354 prevented the age-related reduction in body mass and increased
      soleus, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscle mass (P&lt;0.05). PF-354
      increased fiber cross-sectional area by 12% and enhanced maximum in situ
      force of tibialis anterior (TA) muscles by 35% (P&lt;0.05). PF-354 increased
      the proportion of type IIa fibers by 114% (P&lt;0.01) and enhanced activity
      of oxidative enzymes (SDH) by 39% (P&lt;0.01). PF-354 reduced markers of
      apoptosis in TA muscle cross-sections by 56% (P&lt;0.03) and reduced caspase3
      mRNA by 65% (P&lt;0.04). Antibody-directed myostatin inhibition attenuated
      the decline in mass and function of muscles of aging mice, in part, by
      reducing apoptosis. These observations identify novel roles for myostatin
      in regulation of muscle mass and highlight the therapeutic potential of
      antibody-directed myostatin inhibition for sarcopenia.-Murphy, K. T.,

AB  - Missense mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/Dardarin gene,
      the product of which encodes a kinase with multiple domains, are known to
      cause autosomal dominant late onset Parkinson's disease (PD). In the
      current study, we report that the gene product LRRK2 directly
      phosphorylates the forkhead box transcription factor FoxO1 and enhances
      its transcriptional activity. This pathway was found to be conserved in
      Drosophila, as the Drosophila LRRK2 homolog (dLRRK) enhanced the neuronal
      toxicity of FoxO. Importantly, FoxO mutants that were resistant to
      LRRK2/dLRRK-induced phosphorylation suppressed this neurotoxicity.
      Moreover, we have determined that FoxO targets hid and bim in Drosophila
      and human, respectively, are responsible for the LRRK2/dLRRK-mediated cell
      death. These data suggest that the cell death molecules regulated by FoxO
      are key factors during the neurodegeneration in LRRK2-linked PD.

TI  - Aging and Distraction by Irrelevant Speech: Does Emotional Valence Matter?
AB  - Objectives. From prior studies, we know that older adults are rarely more
      distracted by irrelevant speech than younger adults, which is remarkable
      in light of the inhibitory deficit view of aging. We tested the hypothesis
      that older adults are more distracted by emotional irrelevant speech
      during a visual cognitive task than younger adults. METHODS: Forty-eight
      younger (mean age = 21.9 years) and 48 older individuals (mean age = 68.1
      years) performed a visual counting task while being exposed to irrelevant
      speech consisting of random numbers intermixed with neutral, positive, or
      negative words. Performance in these conditions was compared with that in
      a silence condition. RESULTS: Irrelevant speech increased counting time
      and decreased accuracy similarly for younger and older adults.
      Furthermore, the emotional conditions did not elicit a stronger effect
      than the neutral condition. Finally, we found implicit memory for
      irrelevant speech, but its level was independent of emotional valence and
      age. Discussion. We conclude that emotional irrelevant speech has no
      disproportionate impact on cognitive performance in older adults. This can
      be regarded as a challenge to the inhibitory deficit hypothesis.

TI  - A Two-Factor Model of Successful Aging.
AB  - Objectives. To propose and test a conceptual two-factor model of
      successful aging that includes objective and subjective components.
      METHODS: Data were derived from 5,688 persons aged 50-74 years living in
      New Jersey who participated in the ORANJ BOWL panel. Participants were
      recruited using random digit dial procedures and interviewed by telephone.
      A measurement model was developed and tested using data from two
      independent samples (each n = 1,000); a structural model examining the
      effects of age and gender was tested using data from another 3,688 people.
      RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses provided support for a
      multidimensional model incorporating objective criteria and subjective
      perceptions. Age and gender were associated with objective but not
      subjective success. Discussion. Results add rigor to the measurement of a
      construct that has intrigued philosophers and scientists for hundreds of
      years, providing the empirical foundation on which to build research about
      successful aging.

TI  - A pharmacoepidemiologic study of community-dwelling, disabled older women:
      Factors associated with medication use.
PG  - 215-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although disabled older adults may be among the subpopulation
      of adults with the highest risk for adverse drug events (ADEs), reliable
      data on their use of medications are limited. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this
      study were to describe the extent and patterns of medication use in
      community-dwelling, disabled older women, and to identify factors
      associated with medication use in this population. METHODS:
      Cross-sectional analyses of baseline data on medication use from the
      Women's Health and Aging Study I (WHAS I) were performed. WHAS I was an
      observational study of 1002 community-dwelling women aged &gt;or=65 years who
      self-reported difficulty in at least 2 of 4 domains of physical
      functioning (ie, upper-extremity functions, mobility, self-care, and
      higher functioning tasks needed for independent living in the community).
      After descriptive analyses of their prescription and over-the-counter
      (OTC) drugs, associations between participants' characteristics and
      medication utilization were determined, using generalized linear models.
      RESULTS: Of the 975 participants, 580 (59.5%) used &gt;or=5 medications and
      115 (11.8%) used &gt;or=10 medications (prescriptions and OTCs). The mean
      number of medications used was 3.9 for prescription drugs and 1.9 for OTC
      drugs. Cardiovascular drugs and analgesics were the most frequently used
      prescription and OTC drugs, respectively. Participants with complete
      outcome and covariate data (n = 803) were included in the multivariate
      analyses. Cancer was associated with a 13% increase in total medication
      use (95% CI, 1.00-1.27). Multimorbidity (1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.15), frailty
      (1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26), high Mini-Mental State Examination score (1.03;
      95% CI, 1.01-1.05), congestive heart failure (CHF) (1.39; 95% CI,
      1.23-1.58), angina (1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.44), chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) (1.20; 95% CI, 1.05-1.37), diabetes mellitus (DM)
      (1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43), difficulty with shopping for personal items
      such as medicines and toiletries (1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.35), and possession
      of health insurance (1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.40) or a prescription plan
      (1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.29) were independently associated with increased use
      of prescription drugs. A diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hands (1.29;
      95% CI, 1.121.49) and having a spouse (1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.40) were
      associated with increased use of OTC drugs. Participants with DM (0.78;
      95% CI, 0.65-0.94), African Americans (0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.82), and those
      who had difficulty shopping (0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-0.99) used fewer OTCs than
      did participants without these characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the
      disabled older women in this study took &gt;=5 medications at baseline,
      potentially putting them at high risk for ADEs. Those with multimorbidity,
      frailty, CHF, angina, DM, COPD, cancer, and difficulty with instrumental
      activities of daily living are target subpopulations for polypharmacy
      intervention.

TI  - Does influenza vaccination of older adult Medicare beneficiaries lower
      treatment costs for acute and chronic respiratory disease?
PG  - 201-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza accounts for a large proportion of hospitalizations
      and deaths among older adults, resulting in substantial health care
      expenses. Influenza vaccinations are effective in reducing respiratory
      infections in younger populations, but it is less certain whether they
      reduce costs associated with respiratory infections among older adults.
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether influenza
      vaccination of older adult Medicare beneficiaries reduced costs associated
      with acute and chronic respiratory conditions during 3 recent influenza
      seasons. METHODS: This study analyzed the relationship between influenza
      vaccination and costs for respiratory conditions among Medicare
      beneficiaries &gt;or=55 years of age in influenza seasons (October-May)
      between 2002 and 2005 using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary
      Survey. Two-part multiple regressions of vaccination status were estimated
      on the probability and cost of treating respiratory conditions in each
      influenza season controlling for influenza risk factors and other
      covariates. Various sensitivity tests were conducted by type of service,
      subgroup analysis for specific population risk segments, propensity
      score-matched comparisons, and difference equations. RESULTS: The study
      sample included 13,402 Medicare beneficiaries for the 3 influenza seasons
      examined. Vaccination rates varied between 67.3% and 74.9% over the 3
      influenza seasons. In unadjusted comparisons, no significant difference in
      the cost of treating respiratory conditions was found between vaccinated
      and unvaccinated beneficiaries in 2002/2003 (-$104), but vaccinated
      beneficiaries had significantly higher mean cost differentials in the more
      recent influenza seasons ($258 in 2003/2004, P = 0.012; $254 in 2004/2005,
      P = 0.003). Based on 2-part multiple regressions of vaccine status over
      the 3 seasons combined, costs of respiratory conditions were $142 dollars
      higher on average for vaccinated beneficiaries (P = 0.014). The base
      regression models showed no significant cost savings from vaccination in
      any year. Results of 2 of the 54 sensitivity tests that were conducted
      indicated significant savings from vaccination (inpatient costs for
      2002/2003 and difference in total costs for persons unvaccinated in
      2002/2003 but vaccinated in 2003/2004). CONCLUSION: In this study of older
      adults, no significant cost savings were found with influenza vaccines in
      the 3 influenza seasons examined (2002-2005) when the outcome was measured
      in terms of differential spending for acute and chronic respiratory
      conditions.

TI  - Contribution of beverages to energy, macronutrient and micronutrient
      intake of third- and fourth-grade schoolchildren in Quetzaltenango,
      Guatemala.
PG  - 174-89
AB  - Beverages are selected based on availability, culture, taste preference,
      health, safety and social context. Beverages may be important to energy
      and to the macronutrient and micronutrient quality of overall intake. The
      aim of this study was to determine the contribution of beverages to the
      dietary energy and estimated macro- and micronutrient intake to the diet
      of young schoolchildren. We analyzed data from third- and fourth-grade
      urban Guatemalan school-children aged predominantly 8-10 years old.
      One-day pictorial registries of all beverages, foods and snacks consumed
      over a 24-h period were collected from children from private (n = 219) and
      public (n = 230) schools. Food composition nutrient values were assigned
      to the items consumed. Eleven main categories of beverages were
      identified. The contribution of each of the 11 beverage categories to
      energy, macro- and micronutrients was evaluated. The estimated intake of
      beverages was 475,300 mL, as reported by the 449 children. As a group, the
      beverage consumed in the greatest quantity was coffee (126,500 mL),
      followed by plain water (62,000 mL). Beverages represented a mean energy
      contribution of 418 +/- 26 kcal (21.5% of total dietary energy). The
      beverages varied in energy density from 0 (water) to 1.5 kcal mL(-1) (thin
      gruels). Beverages contributed one-third of the dietary carbohydrate.
      Through the contribution of fortified drinks, beverages were important
      sources of vitamin A (55%), vitamin C (38%), zinc (21%) and calcium (19%).
      Milk was an important source for vitamin D (10%). These results show the
      importance of drinks to nutrition and the balance of concerns of
      overweight/obesity with micronutrient quality.

TI  - Cognitive impairment and life satisfaction in older adults.
PG  - 814-821
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality of life in dementia has been studied in clinical
      settings. There is less population-based research on life satisfaction and
      cognition. OBJECTIVES: (1) To compare the overall life satisfaction (LS),
      LS with material circumstances (LS (material)), and LS with social
      circumstances (LS (social)) of older adults with no cognitive impairment,
      with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), and with dementia; (2) To
      examine the effect of cognition on LS across a broad spectrum of
      cognition; and (3) To explore the effect of factors such as depressive
      symptoms, functional impairment, education, and social support.
      POPULATION: 1620 community-dwelling older adults with a mini-mental state
      examination (MMSE) score &gt; 10, sampled from a representative list were
      interviewed. MEASURES: Age, gender, education, social networks, and social
      supports were all self-reported. The MMSE, the Centre for Epidemiologic
      Studies-Depression (CES-D), and the Older Americans Resource Survey (OARS)
      were used. Dementia was diagnosed by clinical examination using DSM-IIIR
      criteria. LS was measured using the Terrible-Delightful Scale. Factor
      analysis identified two factors: LS (material), and LS (social). A global
      item measuring overall LS was also used. RESULTS: Those with dementia and
      CIND had lower LS than those with normal cognition, but the effect was
      relatively small. There was a gradient in LS which extended into the
      normal range of cognition. Depressive symptoms and functional status were
      strongly associated with LS. CONCLUSIONS: Cognition is associated with LS,
      but the effect is fairly small. Most older adults are satisfied with life.

TI  - Semantic Hyperpriming in Normal Aging: A Consequence of Instructions?
PG  - 1-18
AB  - Semantic hyperpriming has consistently been found in normal aging.
      However, because the standard instructions to test semantic priming are
      generally ambiguous (focusing on both accuracy and speed), it is difficult
      to account for hyperpriming in older adults. By using the direct and
      mediated priming paradigms, this study investigates whether older adults'
      response mode at testing may explain hyperpriming. First, we show that,
      under identical conditions, inducing a response mode that favors speed
      leads to greater priming effects in older adults. The pattern of results
      is similar to what is observed under standard instructions. Second,
      prompting a response mode that favors accuracy leads to greater priming
      effects in younger adults. We discuss various explanations for these
      findings and conclude, in accordance with the Ratcliff, Thapar, Gomez, and
      McKoon (2004a) diffusion model, that hyperpriming in normal aging is
      contingent on older adults' response mode at testing.

TI  - Immunohistochemical analysis of ageing and osteoarthritic articular
      cartilage.
AB  - Articular cartilage degeneration seen in osteoarthritis is primarily the
      consequence of events within the articular cartilage that leads to the
      production of proteases by chondrocytes. 22 osteoarthritic cartilage
      specimens were obtained from patients with primary osteoarthritis (46-81
      years) undergoing total knee replacement. 12 age-matched (41-86 years) and
      16 young (16-40 years) non-osteoarthritic control cartilage specimens were
      obtained from the cadavers in the department of Anatomy and from patients
      undergoing lower limb amputation in Trauma center of PGIMER, Chandigarh. 5
      mu thick paraffin sections were stained for osteocalcin, osteopontin,
      osteonectin and alkaline phosphatase to analyze their expression in
      hypertrophied chondrocytes and osteoarthritic cartilage matrix and to
      compare the staining intensity with that of normal ageing articular
      cartilage. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections revealed
      moderate to strong cytoplasmic staining for all four stains in all the
      specimens of the osteoarthritic group compared to age-matched control. The
      immunohistochemical scores were significantly higher in the osteoarthritic
      group for all four stains. The features of the osteoarthritic articular
      cartilage were markedly different from the non-osteoarthritic age-matched
      articular cartilage suggesting that osteoarthritis is not an inevitable
      feature of aging.

TI  - Myasthenia gravis: a changing pattern of incidence.
AB  - The annual incidence of myasthenia gravis (MG) ranges from 3 to 30 per
      1,000,000 people. Since the mid-1980s, an increasing incidence has been
      reported, mainly due to late-onset MG. Whether the increase was due to
      population aging, improved diagnosis and case collection, or a true excess
      of incidence cases is still under debate. We used a complete enumeration
      approach by reviewing all possible sources of case collection in the
      province of Ferrara, Italy, to estimate the MG incidence and its temporal
      trend over the study period (1985-2007). The mean annual age-adjusted
      incidence of MG was 18 per 1,000,000, without any significant temporal
      trend. The incidence rates in the period 1985-1990 were 14 both for early
      and late-onset MG. Thereafter, a significant increase in incidence of
      late-onset MG (p &lt; 0.05), and a decrease in early onset MG were detected
      (p &lt; 0.01). These findings were related to nonthymoma MG. The median age
      at onset of the disease steadily increased over time. A changing pattern
      of MG incidence with an increase in frequency of late-onset and a decrease
      of early onset MG was found in the last years, giving a significant shift
      to older age at onset of the disease. Unknown environmental factors may
      have driven this change in MG epidemiology.

TI  - Geriatric oncology: an overview of progresses and challenges.
PG  - 61-8
AB  - Thanks to the global improvement of health care and living conditions, the
      world population is aging. Already, in developed countries half of the
      cancers occur in patients aged 70 and older. In booming Asian nations,
      such as South Korea, the aging trend is particularly striking, and
      therefore geriatric oncology is rapidly coming at the foreground of
      oncology practice. As older patients have a very variable health status,
      the need for proper integration of an oncologic and a geriatric approach
      has become increasingly clear. The last two decades have seen the
      development of geriatric oncology programs and research, which we review
      here. An increasing amount of data is making clear that a geriatric
      assessment identifies many problems in older people with cancer, adds
      prognostic information, and might improve the outcomes of these patients.
      The near future will likely deliver the following: Operationalization of
      geriatric assessment into assessment and decision tools, as well as
      multidisciplinary interventions, in oncology; cooperation of aging and
      cancer research in the understanding of cancer biology, aging physiology,
      pharmacology of anticancer drugs; improved clinical study designs;
      development of geriatric oncology programs, and screening tools accessible
      to the private practitioner.

TI  - Uncomplicated resistance training and health-related outcomes: evidence
      for a public health mandate.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - Compared to aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT) has received
      far less attention as a prescription for general health. However, RT is as
      effective as AT in lowering risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
      other diseases. There is a clear ability of RT, in contrast to AT, to
      promote gains, maintenance, or slow loss of skeletal muscle mass/strength.
      Thus, as an antisarcopenic exercise treatment, RT is of greater benefit
      than AT; given the aging of our population, this is of primary importance.
      In our view, a substantial barrier to greater adoption of RT is the
      incorrectly perceived importance of variables such as external load,
      intensity, and volume, leading to complex, difficult-to-follow regimes. We
      propose a more feasible and easier-to-adhere-to paradigm for RT that could
      affect how RT is viewed and adopted as a prescription for public health.

TI  - Downregulation of trefoil factor 3 gene expression in the colon of the
      senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM)-P6 revealed by oligonucleotide
      microarray analysis.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - Global comparison of the colonic gene expression profiles between
      14-month-old senescenceaccelerated mouse (SAM)-P6 mice and SAM-R1 mice, a
      wild-type control, was conducted with an oligonucleotide microarray
      containing more than 5,000 mouse genes. Eight genes were upregulated more
      than two-fold and 94 genes were downregulated more than two-fold in SAM-P6
      mice. The three cell defense genes intelectin1 (Itln1), trefoil factor 3
      (intestinal) (Tff3) and "deleted in malignant brain tumors 1" (Dmbt1) were
      among those extensively downregulated. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
      confirmed that Itln1 mRNA was almost undetectable in SAM-P6 colon, whereas
      it was readily detected in SAM-R1 colon. Colonic expression of both Tff3
      and Dmbt1 mRNA was also substantially decreased, to one third and two
      thirds of the levels in SAM-R1 mice, respectively. A 14 kDa Tff3 dimer was
      detected by Western blotting in the colon of all three SAM-R1 mice, but
      was not present in three SAM-P6 mice. No upregulation of 3 cell defense
      genes was detected in 3-month-old SAM-R1 as well as SAM-P6 mice. These
      results suggest that a diminution of the intestinal trefoil factor system
      may be involved in the acceleration of aging in SAM-P6 mice.

TI  - Comparative Study of the in Vitro Protective Effects of Several
      Antioxidants on Elongation Factor 2 under Oxidative Stress Conditions.
PG  - 1373-9
AB  - One of the biochemical pathways affected by aging in all organisms is
      protein synthesis. Previous reports from our laboratory have indicated
      that the elongation step is specially affected by aging as a consequence
      of alterations in elongation factor-2 (eEF-2). In the present work, we
      studied in vitro the effectiveness of several individual nutritional
      antioxidants in protecting the levels of hepatic eEF-2 subjected to
      oxidative stress induced by cumene hydroperoxide. The in vitro system
      employed consisted of rat liver homogenates treated with cumene
      hydroperoxide. The antioxidants used in this study were lipoic acid,
      coenzyme Q10, tethrahydrofolic acid, and N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone.
      The results indicate that the antioxidants have different capacities to
      prevent eEF-2 loss, folic acid being the most effective. A comparison
      between the antioxidants used and their potential pro-oxidant activity is
      also discussed, on the basis of the oxidative stress parameters measured.

TI  - SOCS1, a novel interaction partner of p53 controlling oncogene-induced
      senescence.
AB  - Members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs)
      family of proteins, which connect cytokine signaling to activation of
      transcription, are frequently activated in human cancers. Suppressors of
      cytokine signaling (SOCS) are transcriptional targets of activated STAT
      proteins that negatively control STAT signaling. SOCS1 expression is
      silenced in multiple human cancers suggesting a tumor suppressor role for
      this protein. However, SOCS1 not only regulates STAT signaling but can
      also localize to the nucleus and directly interact with the p53 tumor
      suppressor through its central SH2 domain. Furthermore, SOCS1 contributes
      to p53 activation and phosphorylation on serine 15 by forming a ternary
      complex with ATM or ATR. Through this mechanism SOCS1 regulates the
      process of oncogene-induced senescence, which is a very important tumor
      suppressor response. A mutant SOCS1 lacking the SOCS box cannot interact
      with ATM/ATR, stimulate p53 or induce the senescence phenotype, suggesting
      that the SOCS box recruits DNA damage activated kinases to its interaction
      partners bound to its SH2 domain. Proteomic analysis of SOCS1 interaction
      partners revealed other potential targets of SOCS1 in the DNA damage
      response. These newly discovered functions of SOCS1 help to explain the
      increased susceptibility of Socs1 null mice to develop cancer as well as
      their propensity to develop autoimmune diseases. Consistently, we found
      that mice lacking SOCS1 displayed defects in the regulation of p53 target
      genes including Mdm2, Pmp22, PUMA and Gadd45a. The involvement of SOCS1 in
      p53 activation and the DNA damage response defines a novel tumor
      suppressor pathway and intervention point for future cancer therapeutics.

TI  - Chemical genetic screen identifies lithocholic acid as an anti-aging
      compound that extends yeast chronological life span in a TOR-independent
      manner, by modulating housekeeping longevity assurance processes.
AB  - In chronologically aging yeast, longevity can be extended by administering
      a caloric restriction (CR) diet or some small molecules. These
      life-extending interventions target the adaptable target of rapamycin
      (TOR) and cAMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathways that are
      under the stringent control of calorie availability. We designed a
      chemical genetic screen for small molecules that increase the
      chronological life span of yeast under CR by targeting lipid metabolism
      and modulating housekeeping longevity pathways that regulate longevity
      irrespective of the number of available calories. Our screen identifies
      lithocholic acid (LCA) as one of such molecules. We reveal two mechanisms
      underlying the life-extending effect of LCA in chronologically aging
      yeast. One mechanism operates in a calorie availability-independent
      fashion and involves the LCA-governed modulation of housekeeping longevity
      assurance pathways that do not overlap with the adaptable TOR and cAMP/PKA
      pathways. The other mechanism extends yeast longevity under non-CR
      conditions and consists in LCA-driven unmasking of the previously unknown
      anti-aging potential of PKA. We provide evidence that LCA modulates
      housekeeping longevity assurance pathways by suppressing lipid-induced
      necrosis, attenuating mitochondrial fragmentation, altering
      oxidation-reduction processes in mitochondria, enhancing resistance to
      oxidative and thermal stresses, suppressing mitochondria-controlled

TI  - Work-Related Exposure to Extremely Low-Frequency Magnetic Fields and
      Dementia: Results from the Population-Based Study of Dementia in Swedish
      Twins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the association between extremely low-frequency
      magnetic fields (EMF) and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease
      using all 9,508 individuals from the Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins
      (HARMONY) with valid occupational and diagnostic data. METHODS: Dementia
      diagnoses were based on telephone screening followed by in-person clinical
      workup. Main lifetime occupation was coded according to an established EMF
      exposure matrix. Covariates were age, gender, education, vascular risk
      factors, and complexity of work. Based on previous research, data were
      also analyzed separately for cases with disease onset by age 75 years
      versus later, men versus women, and those with manual versus nonmanual
      main occupation. We used generalized estimating equations with the entire
      sample (to adjust for the inclusion of complete twin pairs) and
      conditional logistic regression with complete twin pairs only. RESULTS:
      Level of EMF exposure was not significantly associated with dementia or
      Alzheimer's disease. However, in stratified analyses, medium and high
      levels of EMF exposure were associated with increased dementia risk
      compared with low level in cases with onset by age 75 years (odds ratio:
      1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-3.65 for medium, odds ratio: 2.01, 95%
      confidence interval: 1.10-3.65 for high) and in participants with manual
      occupations (odds ratio: 1.81, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-3.09 for
      medium, odds ratio: 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-3.05 for high).
      Results with 42 twin pairs discordant for dementia did not reach
      statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational EMF exposure appears
      relevant primarily to dementia with an earlier onset and among former
      manual workers.

TI  - Aging Adversely Affects the Cigarette Smoke Induced Glutathione Adaptive
      Response in the Lung.
AB  - RATIONALE: Cigarette smoke (CS) is the leading cause of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), accounting for more than 90% of
      cases. The prevalence of COPD is much higher in the elderly, suggesting an
      age dependency. A prominent defense against the oxidant burden caused by
      CS is the glutathione (GSH) adaptive response in the lung epithelial
      lining fluid (ELF) and tissue. However, as one ages the ability to
      maintain GSH levels declines. OBJECTIVE: Examine the effect of aging on
      the GSH adaptive response to CS and resulting lung sensitization to
      inflammation and oxidation. METHODS: Both young (2 months old) and aged
      (8, 13, 19, and 26 months old) mice were used to study the effects of age
      on the GSH adaptive response after an acute exposure to CS. MEASUREMENTS
      AND MAIN RESULTS: Young mice had a robust 6-fold increase in ELF GSH after
      a single exposure to CS. The GSH response to CS decreased as a function of
      age and diminishes in the older mice to only a 2-fold increase over air
      controls. As a consequence, CS-induced TNFalpha and NOS2, markers of
      inflammation, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a marker of DNA oxidation,
      levels were elevated in the aged mice compared to the young mice.
      Additionally, depletion of ELF GSH with buthionine sulfoximine in young
      mice recapitulated changes in ELF TNFalpha as seen in old mice.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the age related maladaptive response
      to CS sensitizes the lung to both inflammation and oxidation potentially
      contributing to the development of CS-induced COPD.

TI  - Suppressive effect of global DNA hypomethylation on gastric
      carcinogenesis.
AB  - Global DNA hypomethylation and concomitant site-specific gene
      hypermethylation are among the most common molecular alterations in human
      neoplasia. Although site-specific DNA hypermethylation has been shown to
      be associated with the development of various tumors accompanied by
      transcriptional silencing of target genes, the functional significance of
      global DNA hypomethylation in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Previous
      studies have revealed that a genetic reduction of the DNA methylation
      levels leads to opposing effects on tumor development, depending on the
      tumor cell type and the stage of tumorigenesis. In the present study, we
      investigated the effect of DNA hypomethylation on gastric carcinogenesis
      in mice. The genetic reduction of DNA methylation levels suppressed the
      incidence, number and size of gastric tumors in two different mouse models
      for gastric tumorigenesis: the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced model
      and the Apc(Min/+) mouse model that spontaneously develops gastric tumors
      with aging. Histological analyses revealed DNA hypomethylation to
      completely inhibit the development of invasive gastric tumors. These
      findings indicate that the reduction of DNA methylation levels suppresses
      gastric carcinogenesis and suggest that DNA methylation is closely
      associated with gastric tumorigenesis.

TI  - Urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and cognitive function in Puerto Rican
      adults.
PG  - 271-8
AB  - DNA oxidative stress has been suggested as an important pathogenic
      mechanism in cognitive impairment and dementia. With baseline data
      collected from 2004 to 2008, the authors examined whether urinary
      8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of global DNA oxidation,
      was associated with cognitive function in a sample of 1,003 Puerto Rican
      adults, aged 45-75 years, living in Boston, Massachusetts, and the
      surrounding area. Cognitive function was measured by using a battery of 7
      tests: the Mini-Mental State Examination, word list learning, digit span,
      clock drawing and figure copying, Stroop, and verbal fluency tests. The
      primary outcome was a global cognitive score, averaging standardized
      scores across all cognitive tests. A higher 8-OHdG concentration was
      significantly associated with lower global cognitive scores, after
      adjustment for age, education, status of the gene for apolipoprotein E
      (APOE), and other covariates (P(trend) = 0.01). The difference in the
      global score, comparing participants in the 2 extreme 8-OHdG quartiles,
      was -0.11 (95% confidence interval: -0.20, -0.02), which was equivalent to
      accelerating cognitive aging by about 4 years, as observed in this
      population. Prospective studies are needed to elucidate whether elevated
      urinary 8-OHdG concentrations can predict the rate of cognitive decline
      and incident dementia.

TI  - NADPH oxidase is involved in protein kinase CKII down-regulation-mediated
      senescence through elevation of the level of reactive oxygen species in
      human colon cancer cells.
PG  - 3137-42
AB  - We have shown that protein kinase CKII (CKII) inhibition induces
      senescence through the p53-dependent pathway in HCT116 cells. Here we
      examined the molecular mechanism through which CKII inhibition activates
      p53 in HCT116 cells. CKII inhibition by treatment with CKII inhibitor or
      CKIIalpha small-interfering RNA (siRNA) increased intracellular hydrogen
      peroxide and superoxide anion levels. These effects were significantly
      blocked by pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.
      Additionally, NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor apocynin and p22(phox) siRNA
      significantly reduced p53 expression and suppressed the appearance of
      senescence markers. CKII inhibition did not affect mitochondrial
      superoxide generation. These data demonstrate that CKII inhibition induces
      superoxide anion generation via NOX activation, and subsequent
      superoxide-dependent activation of p53 acts as a mediator of senescence in
      HCT116 cells after down-regulation of CKII.

TI  - Cigarette smoke-induced Egr-1 represses T beta R-II expression in human
      skin dermal fibroblasts.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - Tobacco smoking is one of the many factors that contribute to premature
      skin aging, but the exact mechanism by which smoking induces facial
      wrinkling is still poorly understood. To investigate the regulatory
      potential of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) on the premature skin aging
      by smoking, this study examined the hypothesis that cigarette
      smoke-induced Egr-1 represses T beta R-II expression in human skin dermal
      fibroblasts (HSDFs). The protein and mRNA expressions of Egr-1 and T beta
      R-II were detected using Western blot and real-time RTPCR in HSDFs after
      exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Egr-1 and T beta R-II promoter
      activities were analyzed in CSE-exposed fibroblasts using luciferase
      assay. T beta R-II promoter activity was also evaluated in HSDFs to be
      transfected with Egr-1 overexpression vector. To investigative
      Egr-1-specific effects, we utilized Egr-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) to
      inhibit Egr-1 expression. The expressions of Egr-1 protein and mRNA were
      increased in a time and dose-dependent manner. CSE also induced Egr-1 at
      the transcription level. Egr-1 was induced though phosphorylation of
      Erk1/2 after CSE exposure in HSDFs. We also observed the immunostained
      Egr-1 proteins were mainly localized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
      after CSE treatment by immunocytochemical analyzes. Furthermore, T beta
      R-II protein and mRNA levels were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by
      CSE and T beta R-II promoter activity was significantly repressed by CSE.
      HSDFs transfected with Egr-1 overexpression vector showed significantly
      reduced T beta R-II promoter activity. In addition, T beta R-II mRNA
      levels were upregulated in HSDFs transfected with Egr-1 siRNA, suggesting
      that T beta R-II expressional downregulation by CSE is induced via an
      Egr-1-dependent mechanism. This study suggests that the downregulation of
      T beta R-II expression by cigarette smoke-induced Egr-1 may contribute to
      smoking-induced premature skin aging.

TI  - Effect of oxidative stress during repeated ovulation on the structure and
      functions of the ovary, oocytes, and their mitochondria.
PG  - 674-81
AB  - We previously reported that superoxide generated in the ovary induces
      apoptosis of granulosa cells to break down follicular walls, thereby
      supporting ovulation in rodents, and suggested that oxidative stress
      underlies the mechanism of ovarian aging. To test this hypothesis, we
      successfully induced ovulation repeatedly in mice by sequentially
      administrating pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, human chorionic
      gonadotropin, and prostaglandin F2alpha. Kinetic analysis revealed that
      the number of ovulated oocytes decreased significantly with repeated
      cycles of ovulation with a concomitant decrease in the gene expression of
      mitochondrial transcription factor A and nuclear respiratory factor 1 and
      an increase in oocytes having abnormally distributed mitochondria.
      Repeated ovulation decreased the amounts of mitochondrial DNA and
      increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in oocytes. Cell culture analysis of the
      in vivo fertilized oocytes revealed that their maturation from two cells
      to blastocyst was inhibited significantly by repeated ovulation. All these
      events induced by repeated ovulation were suppressed by oral
      administration of L-carnitine. These results suggest that oxidative stress
      associated with ovulation underlies the mechanism of ovarian aging and
      that L-carnitine may have therapeutic potential in patients with
      infertility and increased incidence of aneuploidy and to suppress impaired
      maturation of zygotes frequently observed in childbearing at an advanced
      age.

      of dietary fish oil on lifespan and on lipid composition and oxidative
      stress in plasma and liver in SAMP8 mice. Male mice were fed a fish oil
      diet (5% fish oil and 5% safflower oil) or a safflower oil diet (10%
      safflower oil) from 12 wk of age. RESULTS: The SAMP8 mice fed fish oil did
      not have a longer maximum lifespan and had a shorter average lifespan than
      mice fed safflower oil. To examine the mechanism underlying these results,
      the effects on oxidative stress of long-term ingestion of fish oil were
      also examined. SAMP8 mice fed fish oil for 28 wk showed strong oxidative
      stress that caused hyperoxidation of membrane phospholipids and a
      diminished antioxidant defense system due to a decrease in tocopherol
      compared with mice fed safflower oil. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest
      that intake of fish oil increases oxidative stress, decreases cellular
      function, and causes organ dysfunction in SAMP8 mice, thereby promoting
      aging and shortening the lifespan of the mice.

TI  - The Advanced Dementia Prognostic Tool: A Risk Score to Estimate Survival
      in Nursing Home Residents with Advanced Dementia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Estimating life expectancy is challenging in advanced dementia.
      OBJECTIVE: To create a risk score to estimate survival in nursing home
      (NH) residents with advanced dementia. METHODS: This was a retrospective
      cohort study performed in the setting of all licensed U.S. NHs. Residents
      with advanced dementia living in U.S. NHs in 2002 were identified using
      Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments. Mortality data from Medicare files
      were used to determine 12-month survival. Independent variables were
      selected from the MDS. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
      model survival. The accuracy of the final model was assessed using the
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To develop
      a risk score, points were assigned to variables in the final model based
      on parameter estimates. Residents meeting hospice eligibility guidelines
      for dementia, based on MDS data, were identified. The AUROC assessed the
      accuracy of hospice guidelines to predict six-month survival. RESULTS:
      Over 12 months, 40.6% of residents with advanced dementia (n=22,405) died.
      Twelve variables best predicted survival: length of stay, age, male,
      dyspnea, pressure ulcers, total functional dependence, bedfast,
      insufficient intake, bowel incontinence, body mass index, weight loss, and
      congestive heart failure. The AUROC for the final model was 0.68. The risk
      score ranged from 1 to 32.5 points (higher scores indicate worse
      survival). Only 15.9% of residents met hospice eligibility guidelines for
      which the AUROC predicting six-month survival was 0.53. CONCLUSION: A
      mortality risk score derived from MDS data predicted six-month survival in
      advanced dementia with moderate accuracy. The predictive ability of
      hospice guidelines, simulated with MDS data, was poor.

TI  - Age, affective experience, and television use.
PG  - 173-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The reasons for the reportedly high levels of TV watching
      among older adults despite its potential negative health consequences are
      not known. PURPOSE: To investigate age differences in time use and
      affective experience in TV use in a nationally representative sample.
      METHODS: Using an innovative assessment of affective experience in a
      nationally representative sample, several putative reasons were examined
      for age-related increases in TV use. A sample of 3982 Americans aged 15-98
      years who were assessed using a variant of the Day Reconstruction Method,
      a survey method for measuring how people experience their lives, was
      analyzed. To understand age increases in TV use, analyses examined whether
      older people (1) enjoy TV more; (2) watch TV because it is less stressful
      than alternatives; or whether (3) TV use was related to age differences in
      demographics, being alone, or life satisfaction. Data were collected in
      2006 and analyzed in 2008-2009. RESULTS: Adults aged &gt;65 years spent
      threefold more waking time watching TV than young adults. Despite this
      trend, older people enjoyed TV less, in contrast to stable enjoyment with
      other leisure activities. Older adults did not seem to experience the same
      stress-buffering effects of watching TV as did young and middle-aged
      adults. This negative age-associated trend in how TV was experienced was
      not accounted for by demographic factors or in time spent alone. Greater
      TV use, but not time spent in other leisure activities, was related to
      lower life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults watch more TV but enjoy
      it less than younger people. Awareness of this discrepancy could be useful
      for those developing interventions to promote reduced sedentary behaviors
      in older adults.

TI  - Remodelling of the human vitreous and vitreoretinal interface - A dynamic
      process.
AB  - The highly hydrated, almost acellular vitreous body of the human eye
      consists of only 0.1% macromolecules, of which collagens are the most
      important for its matrix structure. During embryological development, the
      human vitreous body is a highly dynamic matrix, in which the primary
      (vascular) vitreous is gradually replaced by the secondary (avascular)
      vitreous. With aging, the human vitreous undergoes a slowly progressive
      remodelling, characterized by the gradual formation of collagenous
      condensations and liquefied spaces in the gel structure. The former is
      probably the result of collagen synthesis and the deposition of newly
      formed collagen into the matrix, while the latter is probably due to
      collagen breakdown. Therefore, remodelling of the vitreous matrix starts
      at a very early age and continues into old age, albeit at a slower pace.
      Older theories and concepts of a strict spatial separation between the
      primary and secondary vitreous during embryonic development, and
      morphological changes in the aging vitreous being due to a simple
      aggregation of collagen fibrils are questioned. This review describes the
      embryological and postnatal remodelling of the human vitreous matrix and
      vitreoretinal interface, in addition to the mechanisms and cells that are
      potentially involved in this process.

TI  - APP(DeltaNL695) expression in murine tissue downregulates CNBP expression.
AB  - The cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) is a ubiquitously
      expressed protein involved in regulation of transcription and translation.
      CNBP, and its encoding gene ZNF9, have been shown to be involved in type 2
      myotonic dystrophy. Both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sporadic inclusion
      body myositis (sIBM) are age-related degenerative diseases associated with
      the accumulation of beta-amyloid. Overexpression of amyloid precursor
      protein (APP) in mice has been used to generate models of both diseases.
      We show here that overexpression of APP in skeletal muscle from a mouse
      model of sIBM reduces the expression of CNBP significantly. We examined
      CNBP expression in a brain-specific APP-overexpressing strain, and a whole
      body APP knock-in strain, and found that there was a reduction in CNBP
      expression in tissue expressing APP(Swe). We conclude that expression of
      APP(Swe) in murine tissue induces a decrease in CNBP expression. This
      effect does not appear to be due to alterations in CNBP transcription.
      APP(Swe) expression may provide a tool for the study of CNBP regulation
      and clues to the roles of both proteins in disease.
