<p>
-Installing Oochis EHR (the PHR app is being developed as teh EHR until such time as a fork is introduced at the end of development that removes clinical functionality):
<br>
Installing the complete Oochis EHR solution component-framework assumes a compatible computer device* and the 'Oochis EHR Installer' application from (http://www.oochis.org) or (http://oochisehr.googlecode.com).
<br><br>
<ul>
   <li>Run (click or double click), 'Oochis EHR Installer' (henceforth simply, &quotthe installer:&quot [ICON IMAGE]).</li>
   <li>The installer will first request a directory for program files.</li>
   <li>The installer will then request the directory of where to place a claims file (a text file of medically encoded health data entries for billing and claims software). The claims file is the same as the printable report found in: 'Practice Assistant', 'Reports', 'Coded entries'.</li>
   <li>If the network Internet connection can be found, The installer will then request if a security-enhanced web browser is used in a Decision Support window. The Oochis EHR installer will download and install the browser automatically. This browser is only for Oochis EHR use.</li>
   <li>The installer then requests a user name and password for the system administrators. The same system administrators can manage multiple installations.</li>
   <li>The installer then request the number of login re-attempts allowed before the system administrators is required to login.</li>
   <li>The installer will ask what the name of the network is.</li>
   <li>An icon is placed on the desktop (or /user/home if no 'desktop' directory is found in an expected location).
       <br>
       Oochis EHR installation is now finished.</li>
       <br>
       Suggestions:
       <br>
      <ul>
         <li>Start and login to Oochis EHR (see &quot-Starting and logging in&quot).</li>
         <li>Create a user with administrator privileges. Keep this user name and password available and in a secure place. Use this user account for administrative work, saving the system administrators created during installation as a backup account. As per NCO EHR certification criteria, "emergency access," is also provided via a special user name and password listed in the README.TXT that comes with each Oochis EHR release.</li>
         <li>Change appearance settings (colors; wallpaper; translucency; font; and bordering) in 'System' &#8594 'Appearance'.</li>
