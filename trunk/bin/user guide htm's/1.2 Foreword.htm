Oochis EHR solution (henceforth simply &quotOochis EHR&quot) is a developmental open source object-oriented EHR solution. An EHR solution is the health recording software in a professional Health Information System (HIS). The type of HIS Oochis EHR is modeled in (and named after) is the Object-Oriented Community Health Information System.
<br><br>
Oochis PHR application (henceforth simply &quotOochis PHR&quot) is a developmental open source EHR application. A PHR application is the health recording software for individuals. Oochis PHR is designed to function in our modern health system.
<br><br>
The EHR and PHR softwares are developed together as one software product, with the PHR application having clinical features such as CPOE and prescription filling removed. While it is possible for an individual to view and manage their health record using the EHR solution, the PHR application minimizes the software to features usable by (non-clinical) individuals (such as patients). As such, features that only apply to the EHR solution are labeled as such in this use guide (using, &quotapplies to EHR only&quot). When the software is ready for general use, this disparity will be recognized in separate user guides.
<br><br>
The OOCHIS (the most-encompassing system the EHR software is modeled in) is diagrammed in figure 1: the &quotOOCHIS crystal.&quot This diagram models health information technologies as they fit together into a HIS with emphasis on practical use and development in a supporting collaborative community. The OOCHIS can be copied and customized for use in clinical HISs whether developmental or otherwise. Statements and methods in the OOCHIS diagram may be used in establishing formal HIS specifications and requirements, as well as in guiding technical HIS/EHR solution development and customization.
<br><br>
This user guide explains how to use and change Oochis EHR software. The OOCHIS model is a precise framework of health information system objects generally applicable to the development and maintenance of any modern EHR solution. The Oochis EHR solution is not unique inasmuch as it is a generalized working model of technologies arising from a concerted effort in medicine over the last 50 years (see time line). The primary impetus behind Oochis EHR development is to provide as many people as possible with affordable access to high quality health care. Health care providers that embrace these dogmatic and learned technologies are (very) likely to be the most competitive.
<br><br>
This user guide also instructs users on how to translate HIS requirements into completed machine code, and vs. versus, from machine code into HIS specifications. In a work environment, the ability to transliterate between normative language (medical English) and actual machine code provides medical informaticists and clinicians with the ability to both understand and collaborate on planned changes to a HIS or EHR solution. This is true regardless of whether OOCHIS EHR is the specific EHR solution used. For example, knowing precisely where in a HIS that Decision Support interacts with other HIS components ameliorates complex meaning and information overload.
<br><br>
A Personal Health Record (PHR) application will be released to fully empower patients with their health records. The PHR application will be derived from the EHR solution by removing clinical objects such as CPOE and management of user accounts. Such a PHR application will provide the highest level of patient empowerment, much more than summary patient printouts.
<br><br>
A PHR application should provide individuals with the ability to view their health records in their entirety regardless of where recorded (such as in hospitals, clinics, or from primary health care providers). Health information, though recorded across various providers and systems, is property of the individual, and should be as portable as any electronic file. This putative &quotOOCHIS PHR application,&quot will be used not only to view an individual's health record, but to empower individuals with effective cost analyses for expected and wanted treatments. The patient should be expected to be able to control their own quality and quantity (years) of life. Moreover, the patient should be expected to know and control their own danger of acquiring diseases. The patient should be able to choose their own provider networks and treatment plans, and be able to use cost analyses features that leverage payment tables with their (legally protected) right to effective health insurance.
