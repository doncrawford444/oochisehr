<h2 id="sectionHeader">1.4 OOCHIS crystal diagram</h2>
<p>
Each software application has it's own OOCHIS crystal (found in Oochis EHR's 'System Development' feature) Version 1 of Oochis EHR will use the source code directly from within it's own diagram. This featutre enabling real-time changes during formal vetting processes.
<br><br>
Components of the OOCHIS crystal diagram:
<ol>
   <li>Oochis EHR solution's UML class diagram. The precise UML class diagram of Oochis EHR dominates the lower portion of the OOCHIS diagram.</li>
   <li>The user guide. The user guide is displayed on top to connect the descriptions of EHR solution objects to their source code equivalents.</li>
   <li>The home page. This is in the middle on the left. The home page downloads runnable Oochis EHR solution and PHR app softwares. The Oochis EHR program includes a 'System Development' feature to zoom in and out of the OOCHIS diagram.</li>
   <li>The file repository. Collaborative community project file-sharing is hosted by a repository site in the middle-right of the diagram.</li>
   <li>A crystal diagram with one starting action (creating and opening a new health record) and one endpoint (projected life spans in the Decision Support window). This simple state machine (crystal) diagram identifies all the objects, actions, method invocations, and attribute values necessary to produce the projected life spans displayed on the right; life spans being an exemplary summary outcome metric to gauge the overall effectiveness of providing as many people as possible with affordable access to high quality health care.</li>
</ol>
Each new Oochis EHR and PHR release (beginning with version 0.1.1.1) will be posted on the home page with usage statistics. There are no restrictions on who may use or contribute changes to the software.
<br><br>
The OOCHIS diagram contains millions of characters. The entire image is more than 400 pages if zoomed out and printed. Oochis software contains a 'System Development' feature for zooming in and out of the diagram.
