The business of health care has been carefully experimenting with health information technologies since the 1960s (see Table 1. &quotTime line&quot). Innovation, complex meaning, and information overload all became the norm in dealing with health information systems. However, recent system-wide adoption (use of certified EHR solutions increased from 50% to 60% in 2013) of standardized health information technologies* combined with certification criteria has created a generalized EHR solution architecture. This EHR solution is now providing the wanted automation of medical processes with advanced decision support tools. Oochis EHR solution is to be certified when it's feature list is completed (feature completion is being tracked on the home page).
<br><br>
The ability to transliterate executive requirements with source code conveys the full utility of an open sourced EHR solution. As well, the inability of closed proprietary systems to transparently transliterate between formal requirements and source code imparts complex meaning to otherwise straightforward tasks. Also, biomedical informatics (EHR programming) training is focused on implementing this largely open sourced OOCHIS. Precisely functioning medical objects and components are visibly shown working in the model itself. The ability to straightforwardly transliterate between requirements and source code ameliorates information overload and the danger of complex meaning. Simple stalwart medical processes are simply not hidden in the complex semantics of vendor representatives.
<br><br>
*Technologies include: hardware; data exchange formats; vocabularies; standard features (NCO certification criteria), OOP, virtual machines. Moreover, so long as the application source code is business-object compatible (naming of objects are understandable by non-programmers), the OOCHIS architecture endows quick and reliable processing of medical business objects (see, &quotMedical business object processing guideline&quot).
<br><br>
The business of health IT vending is undergoing a paradigm shift away from unintuitive and expensive application implementation and integration services, towards straightforward distribution and technology support of Oochis EHR solution applications. The OOCHIS diagram and the Oochis EHR solution's structured source code provides the precise guidance necessary to reliably complete technical deliverables (see, &quotMedical business object processing guide&quot). While innovation of HIS implementations is made practical, complex meaning and information overload are out.
<br><br>
The OOCHIS will be around for generations, yet, any conceivable object, any algorithm, rule, or requirement—any customization—is guided to where it can be a formal component in the source code. Formal components (technically &quotclassifiers&quot) in object-language naturally encapsulate (and describe) any project's coveted work requirements and deliverables. Moreover, the use of properly named components minimizes or excludes as unnecessary, work on abstract medical business objects such as implementation and integration (see 'Deleting, modifying, and adding software components: ' ). The word, implementation means simply installing a program, yet was confoundedly adopted in the IT field to mean a design phase for installations of EHR and HIS solutions prior to the OOCHIS [see time line]. As well, integrations should be as straightforward as the tasks they describe, and not require superfluous work stemming from vendor concerns about keeping proprietary code hidden in some magical plane of existence.
<br><br>
Benefits of EHR solutions: EHR solutions reduce human errors, lower costs, and allow better health care.
<br><br>
Only seven percent of patients (with diabetes) received standard basic care at paper-based practices, while fifty-one percent received standard care when physicians used EHR software1. The reduction in human error by using EHR software versus paper-based charts may save, at minimum, 48000 to 98000 lives each year1.
<br><br>
The CHIS/EHR framework (figure 1) provides a more detailed picture of individual and community health than alternative systems [Showstack 1996 – CIS book pg 3]. Even closed proprietary systems (both large and small) can benefit greatly from the open network architecture of CHIS/EHR (see &quot-Networking&quot).
