<h2 id="sectionHeader">1.8 Preparing for an EHR implementation</h2>
<p>
The practice of implementing EHR solutions is moving away from complex implementation, customization, and redundant integration contracts and consultation (GE Centricity), and towards straightforward use and tech support of standardized EHR solutions.
<br><br>
Hardware:
<br>
Modern Windows, Linux, and Apple, and Android devices (computers, laptops, notebooks, tablets, and phones) are able to run Oochis EHR as a regular application. Setting up a network is straightforward, and can be set up in-house using hardware manufacturers' directions. Other than a normal Internet-connected computer-network that includes printers, and CORBA and DICOM devices, the only special hardware that may be necessary is a secured, redundant storage server to reliably and safely store health data. Otherwise, choosing and setting up hardware is straightforward, quick, standardized, and relies primarily on the practice's wants and needs.
<br><br>
Software:
<br>
Use an NCO-certified complete EHR solution. Oochis EHR is not NCO-certified. Oochis EHR solution software is free, and available from it's file repository and on-line (www.oochis.org).
<br><br>
Implementation:
<br>
Robust EHR frameworks (quickly installable open sourced and proprietary applications) are making traditionally complex implementation obsolete. Implementations should focus on integration and customization, and customization should not have to be necessary just to get the EHR solution to run. Implementation is ideally through an automated installation process with automatic (plug-n-play) integration. And, inasmuch as is possible, customization should be handled through features of the software. Only special circumstances should instigate a formal medical information technology project with implementation costs.
<br><br>
Support:
<br>
In addition to this user guide, the Oochis EHR solution can be mastered through:
<ul>
   <li>Practice (becoming familiar with the semantic structure by using it)</li>
   <li>Homepage (http://www.oochis.org)</li>
   <li>File repository (file sharing site) (http://oochisehr.googlecode.com). Moderate tech support is available by communicating in the forum and wiki pages to volunteer developers and users.</li>
   <li>Efficient, hourly consulting and support is also offered to help answer questions (providing an on-call &quothelp desk&quot), train, guide information technology projects and deliverables, and to help implement rules and other business objects.</li>
</ul>
As well, in-house integration expertise may be needed to integrate all applications and components into the practice's finished health information system. Similarly, customization expertise may be needed to add, modify, or delete components. Integration and customization services may be available (usually for a nominal hourly rate) on a case-by-case basis. Customizations (any and all modifications) may focus on: templates (to match a practice's hard-copy medical forms to computer output), the 'Order-entry' and other panels, data integrations (with other softwares).
