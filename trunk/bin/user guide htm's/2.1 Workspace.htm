<h2 id="sectionHeader">2.1 Workspace</h2>
<p>
Oochis's workspace is the area on the screen displayed after logging in. The workspace has a wallpapered, &quotdesktop,&quot appearance with a task-bar (see, &quot-Task bar,&quot next section) on the bottom.
<br><br>
Not all workspaces look the same for every user. If authorized to do so, users may customize the look and feel of Oochis EHR. Also, the availability of specific features depends on authorization from the system administrators. To view the components that may not be available in the workspace, open 'System' &#8594 'User accounts &#8594 'Authorizations'; all other features are available by default.

{window icons}
<br><br>
Each user's unique arrangement of windows and content are restored to the configuration that existed when last logged out. The arrangement of windows and content can also be restored to the configuration that existed when a specific chart was last closed by pressing ALT while opening the chart.
<br><br>
Content may be copied and pasted between Oochis EHR and other applications just like between an Internet browser and a text editor.
<br><br>
Oochis EHR toggles between full-screen and windowed modes by pressing, 'CTRL' + 'ALT' + 'F'.

Task bar. The task bar is the bar on bottom of the screen. The task bar contains, from left-to-right, a Oochis EHR decal, buttons ('Login,' 'System', 'Charting', 'Messaging', 'Decision Support', and 'Practice'), and a clock. The 'Login' button logs out the account holder, closes the workspace, and displays the login screen. The other five buttons open windows of the same name (e.g., the 'System' button opens the 'System' window). The clock displays the computer-device's system time.
