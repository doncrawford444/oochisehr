<font color="#8B0000">'New chart'</font> ('Charting' [menu bar] &#8594 'New chart'):<br>
To create a new chart, click 'New chart', and choose a chart template in the drop down menu. Chart templates are created in 'System' &#8594 'Templates'. The process of creating a chart template is similar to creating a document in a word processor. See 'Templates' for information on how to create chart templates. Enter, &quotexample,&quot in the ‘New chart’ drop-down menu to get a feel for what a new (but empty) chart looks like.
</p>
<p id="indentedParagraph20px">
<font color="#8B0000">'Open chart'</font> ('Charting' [menu bar] &#8594 'Open chart'):<br>
Click, 'Open chart' to open a chart. A dialog will be displayed for entering patient identifiers. Unique patient identifiers are: chart ID; social security number; and driver's license number. Charts can also be looked up using patient names and birth dates. Patient names and birth dates are not unique and may return multiple charts. If multiple charts are returned, demographic information in each chart is displayed, enabling further selection.
<br><br>
To open a recently opened chart, select (click on) a recently opened chart from the list at the bottom of the 'Open chart' dialog box. Recently opened charts are identified with the chart's chart ID, and the patient's name, sex, and birth date.
</p>
<p id="indentedParagraph20px">
<font color="#8B0000">'Close chart'</font> ('Charting' [menu bar] &#8594 'Close chart'):<br>
Click, 'Close' to close a chart. If any chart additions have not been signed off, a dialog panel is displayed prompting the user to 'Sign-off and close (the) chart', or to 'Close (the) chart without signing off'.
</p>
<p id="indentedParagraph20px">
<font color="#8B0000">'Find'</font> ('Charting' &#8594 'Menu bar' &#8594 'Find'):<br>
Click 'Find' to search a chart for specific content. A search dialog will be displayed to enter search queries, constrain searches to sections or pages, and navigate through returns.

<font color="#8B0000">'Summary and discharge'</font> ('Charting' [menu bar] &#8594 'Summary and discharge'):<br>
Clicking 'Summary and discharge' opens a note with 'Summary and discharge' information filled-in automatically using chart information and rules-based processing (such as supplying recommended handouts automatically when specific encoded items are ordered and via {{{those created using scripts and recorded user events}}} ).
</p>
<p id="indentedParagraph20px">
<font color="#8B0000">'Note pad'</font>  ('Charting' [menu bar] &#8594 'Note pad'):<br>
Narrative (any and all narrative, although especially pertaining to the note pad notes) is not encoded nor connected to an EHR unless explicitly added to a chart. Notes can be added to any chart item by activating the 'Attach to current order' button, or by dropping or pasting the note (or text content) onto the item. Notes can also be added directly as encoded narratives by dropping or pasting the note (or text content) on CPOE panel (where it is processed as a coded entry) of an open chart.
<br><br>
Attach a clinical note to a pending order by right-clicking the order slip in 'Activities' CPOE panel. The note pad will open, and the note attached as narrative to the order. Attached notes are displayed in the CPOE's order slip panel. Closing the note pad with unsaved changes prompts the user to save any changes before closing.
<br><br>
Content can be dropped or pasted onto the workspace from another application or directory. The workspace serves as a desktop-like area to store working items.
<br><br>
Content can be exchanged between Oochis EHR's note pad and third party applications by cutting, copying, and pasting, as well as dragging and dropping.
<br><br>
Remember, you may click CTRL + ALT + M to minimize Oochis EHR to your operating system’s task bar in order to cut/copy and paste and drag and drop between Oochis EHR and other applications.
