<p>
Messaging handles messages (emails and multi-media text messages), alerts (such as contraindications and messages flagged as urgent), and contact information.
<br><br>
Send content and pages as messages or attachments in standard formats (text, odf, doc, rtf, html, and images)*.
<br><br>
Send specific order items to patients, such as what prescriptions were ordered, and later, when they are filled. A dialog is displayed when an incomplete order is sent. The dialog panel choices are: 'Send incomplete'; 'Send when (the order is) completed'; and, 'Send both' (now, and when the order is completed). To send a patient laboratory results in the email, automatically when the results come in, click 'Send when completed', or, 'Send both'.
<br><br>
Messaging has four panels described below as they appear from left-to-right and top-to-bottom:
