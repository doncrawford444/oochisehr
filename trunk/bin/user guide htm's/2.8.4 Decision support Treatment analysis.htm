<p id="indentedParagraph">
<font color="#8B0000">'Treatment analysis'</font> ('Decision Support' &#8594 'Treatment analysis'):<br>
'Treatment analysis' provides and contains the basic tools: 'Cost analysis'; 'Treatment effect'; 'Decision
models'; 'Life expectancy'; and 'Optimized life expectancy.'
to convey analyses (such as the 'Cost analysis', 'Treatment effect', 'decision models', and life curves)
and portable forms.
<br><br>
A special not about context: objects must be named, and where possible used, even in standard
protocoling... The &quotelectronic&quot part of any &quottreatment analysis&quot proper, is not more than the human part.
As well, general software not relegated to the domain of health information is used to record all kinds
of notes and create all kinds of documents including spreadsheets, emails, and texts, and provide
critical voice communication services. The 'Treatment analysis' object provides a standard set of
&quottreatment analytics&quot tools, as well as providing for DS as per NCO criteria.
<br><br>
Wrote and peer-supported knowledge and services, as well mnemonic symbols and diagrams in paper
and pen, chalkboards, and white boards are more important - general global context - than electronic
'Treatment analysis'; yet 'Treatment analysis' provides standard electronic tools (or applications, or
&quotapps&quot), as well as providing for DS as per NCO criteria. Moreover the ability to integrate other
software components (such as other HIS components) within the 'Decision Support' &#8594 'Treatment
analysis' component as in-house customized practice applications is one of the most
powerful aspects of the Oochis EHR solution. This is more user-controlled treatment analysis, that
combined with the CHIS/EHR architectural model (see CHIS/EHR figures), fully encompasses
modern, standard, and (currently and standardizing 50 years into the future) state-of-the-art in medical
business object and health IT processing.
<br><br>
See, &quotCustomizing,&quot for further information on programming and customizing.
<br><br>
The Treatment analysis panel contains a menu-bar that applies to 'Cost analysis'; 'Treatment effect';
'Decision models' only. These features are considered provider information. Life expectancies and
optimized life expectancies are calculated directly from (and require) a patient chart.
<br><br>
The buttons on the menu bar all perform the same actions regardless of whether a 'Cost analysis' a
'Treatment analysis' or a 'Decision Models' is open.
<br><br>
Life expectancy and optimized life expectancy are calculated using only EHR data, not user-entered
data, and so there is no savable data except that already saved in the EHR. Therefore only the menu-bar
buttons' 'Send', 'Add note', and, 'Print' are active.
<br><br>
If 'Cost analysis' is selected, then the menubar buttons pertain to the 'Cost analysis'.
there is no file, just calculations based on an open chart's data
<br><br>
The life expectancy curve is not a treatment analysis proper, but is used in place of a mortality rate
alone to describe any affects on life-span. together with the patients mortality-affecting EHR entries
may provide a more intuitive model of the effects of mortality rates than the numerical rate alone. and
exhaustive, or &quottotal&quot effect on life may provide more proficient treatment planning (quicker, easier,
and more [descriptive] content).

<p id="indentedParagraph20px">
<font color="#8B0000">'Cost analysis'</font> ('Decision Support' &#8594 'Treatment analysis' &#8594 'Cost analysis'):<br>
'Cost analysis' contains a 2D graph plot with cost plotted along the horizontal axis and utility along the vertical. The points are used to calculate ICER values, ranked according to utility, then plotted and connected together into a line graph. All of this is together on one page, with a page header stating the name of the cost analysis, when it was created, when it was last modified, and by whom (last modified it).
<br><br>
The page is useful to analyze and convey if - and where - the curve starts to become asymptotic (see below).
<br><br>
The page can also be attached to an order.
<br><br>
Where an inexpensive prescription has a more relative benefit to a patient.
<br><br>
All pages, including 'Cost analysis' can also be quickly referenced, attached to health orders and items, and sent as an attachment to a text message or email.
<br><br>
The point where (the increase in) cost becomes negligible (or becomes unreasonably justifiable) is generally where the curve starts to become straight (see figure).

<font color="#8B0000">'Life expectancies'</font> ('Decision Support' &#8594 'Treatment analysis' &#8594 'Life expectancies'):<br>
Since Life expectancy and optimized life expectancy features are calculations, and do not use any data except EHR data, the 'New', 'Open', 'Close', 'Save', 'Save as' buttons are inactivated; menu-bar buttons' 'Send', 'Add note', and, 'Print' remain active. To return to the life expectancy calculations for a patient, re-open the patient's chart. Life calculations are standard calculations that take in standard mortality rates for (amongst many other considerations): age; BMI; disease states (asthma, arthritis, diabetes), conditions (smoking, occupation, pregnancy), and therefore use EHR data, not user-entered (thusly not savable) data.
<br><br>
'Treatment Analysis's Life expectancy calculations no longer display information when a chart closes.

'Average life span, 1969 to 2008' ):<br>
This is a &quotpop-up&quot display panel providing reference, or baseline life curves in order to see what they look like, and how they are changing over time. They are useful to compare with extrapolated life curves, as well as give a baseline to patient life expectancies, as well as the affect on life spans over time for a mortality change.
<br><br>
Average life spans for the indicated sex and race are plotted against the calendar year, from 1969 to 2008:
<br><br>
Average life spans are given for:
<ul>
   <li>Both sexes, all races:</li>

The 'Actuarial life expectancy' panel is the life expectancy curve that is displayed when at the 'Life
expectancy' panel.
<br><br>
'Actuarial life expectancy' panel is the nominal set of - the unmodified calculations of - life expectancy
from extant mortality (existing conditions).

<font color="#8B0000">'Optimized life expectancy'</font> ('Decision Support' &#8594 'Treatment analysis' &#8594 'Life expectancy' &#8594
'Optimized life expectancy'):<br>
The increase per year is added to the actuarial life expectancies to get the baseline medical life expectancies.
<br><br>
Infa.: Infallibility factor of the expected treatment (0 = disease state, 1 = never fail). An infallibility factor of 0.7 means the treatment (such as a replacement heart) will function at .7 (70% of the disease-state mortality, pending a complete procedure).
<br><br>
Proc.: Procedural completeness factor of the expected treatment (0 = not performed, 1 = complete). A procedural completeness factor of 1.0 means the treatment (replacement heart is fully functioning without any remaining heart tissue. Treatment analysis often uses life years or quality-adjust life years (quality-years, or &quotqualys,&quot often capitalized, &quotQUALYS&quot). This term for quality could be factored together with infallibility.
<br><br>
The product of these two factors is what reduces the mortality caused by the disease(s).

The 'Life expectancy' graph is no longer displayed when a chart closes.

'Life expectancy (and it's sub-feature, 'Optimized life expectancy')....save', or 'save as' because it is calculated with every open and closed chart.
