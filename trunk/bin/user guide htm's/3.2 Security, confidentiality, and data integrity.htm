<h2 id="sectionHeader">3.2 Security, confidentiality, and data integrity</h2>
<p>
Access to patient data is secured by password-authenticated Oochis EHR logins. All data is stored encrypted using the 256-bit AES encryption standard. All patient-identifiable data is sent encrypted in HL7 messages. Oochis EHR also provides audit tracking by recording, and never deleting, every access to data (see 'Practice Assistant' &#8594 'Reports' &#8594 'Logs').
<br><br>
Best practices for patient and provider confidentiality and data security:
<ul>
   <li>Install firewalls on all computers hooked up to the Internet.</li>
   <li>Make sure your operating system's security patches are up to date.</li>
   <li>Make sure sensitive data accessed from the Internet is encrypted.</li>
   <li>Use virus checking software.</li>
   <li>Change passwords</li>
</ul>
Also note that threats can come from email, and insiders account for about 85% of all threats. Basic practice in this area commonly addresses:
<ul>
   <li>The need to screen employees.</li>
   <li>Do not leave confidential information such as papers, memory devices and logged-in computers (log-out when away from the computer device).</li>
   <li>Destroy provider (your) data when no longer needed. Patient health data can not be deleted.</li>
</ul>
